I'm a long time user of iTunes, and I'm a fan of its smart playlists, album views, and mini player, but as time goes on it gets more and more bloated, and less user friendly. I don't want my music manager have music store integration, an app manager, iPhone backups, movies, books, etc. I also don't want my music manager to consume hundreds of megabytes of memory. The nail in the coffin is that iTunes still has no built-in way of fixing up my butchered tags and missing album art, so I have to resort to using external programs like [Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) to do so (I suppose the iTunes way these days is to pay for iTunes Match or subscribe to Apple Music). I like software that is simple, powerful, and free.

I recently had the good fortune of discovering the command line music organizer Beets, which brands itself as "the media library management system for obsessive-compulsive music geeks."
