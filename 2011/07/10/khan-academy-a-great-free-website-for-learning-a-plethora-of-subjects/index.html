        I have been writing at ByteRevel since its inception in 2011 and helped make it what it is today. I've always been fascinated by the intersection between human phenomena and computing, specifically in fields of education, financial markets, and creative design. My programming interests are in machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, cryptography, blockchain infrastructure, market making, simulation and modeling, and quantum computing. Outside of ByteRevel, I co-founded and spent four years working on a software consulting company, Quadral Apps (It's now defunct as the founders have all left). My interests outside of computer science are poverty alleviation, humanitarian engineering, education, financial markets and economics research.

        <p>Khan Academy is a website that contains Free Instructional and Teaching Videos that range from teaching Biology to Economics to Algebra. It has been sponsored heavily by Bill Gates who supports this website, which is peculiar because there is a sackful of websites that have teaching services and a handful with free teaching services. One of the main reasons Bill Gates supports this website over others is due to the fact it has 2,400 videos (totaling 60 million views) all created by 1 person. That’s right! 1 person runs the entire “Khan Academy.”</p>

<p><strong>Salman Khan</strong></p>

<p>Salman Khan is the man behind all of the 2400 videos. Salman Khan is from a Bengali heritage, but lived in the US. He graduated his High School as its valedictorian and went on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. At M.I.T., he received an MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, BS in Electrical Engineering, and a BS in Mathematics. At Harvard, he received an MBA. Sounds educated, huh?</p>

<p>Well, according to the video on his website, Salman Khan was tutoring his cousins when he had the idea of constructing a website where he could teach people around the world. Everything went uphill from there; He received a $2 million grant from Google, full sponsorship from Bill Gates, and some other awards.</p>
