One such media center is Boxee. Boxee boasts social network features, 200+ apps, and a local media aggregator and organizer. The apps include Pandora, Netflix, a browser (for watching web video that isn&#8217;t supported in an app), YouTube, Revision3, and MTV Music. If you are an individual that lives with the luxury of having all of your movies, TV shows, and music on one computer, then you are sure to love the convenience of using the Boxee user interface to browse your media. On the other hand, if you are a cheapskate that cut the cable and doesn&#8217;t have a winter&#8217;s survival stock of media, Boxee is perfect for web video consumption and will fill most of your &#8220;needs&#8221;.           Boxee is currently, as of January 2011, in beta. I have been a loyal Boxee fan and have, over the years, watched it slowly grow into a great and stable product.           D-Link, the company behind Boxee, recently released a box that goes for $199 on Amazon. It is capable of connecting to recent models of TVs that support HDMI.

In contrast to Boxee, Plex (currently) only runs on Macs, and has a smaller selection of apps to be downloaded from the store (it still covers all of the most popular apps such as Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu!). Also unlike Boxee, Plex puts emphasis on media library organization and viewing. The UI of Plex is quite pleasing, and the homepage consists of a wheel that scrolls through the different pages of Plex. The media pages such as Music and Movies have a very simple and elegant interface that makes accessing your media fun and beautiful.

        "title": "Use DOSBox For Smooth, Clean DOS Emulation!",
        "excerpt":"For those of you unfamiliar with DOS, here’s a quick summary: DOS, or Disk Operating System, was the dominate type of operating system for IBM personal computers in the 1980’s and 1990’s. One of the most known disk operating systems was Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS). MS-DOS had a command line interface, unlike modern day OS’s, due to the limitations in technology at the time. Anyhow, the purpose of this post is not to give you a history lesson on ancient operating systems, but rather to inform you that you can still use MS-DOS on your fancy new computers with the newest operating systems around.You might think “Why the heck would I want to use an outdated OS?!?!?” For one thing, you probably don’t want to use it for ease of use or eye candy (it lacks both!), but rather to relive the era of revolutionary games of the time. Yes, that’s right- great games were made back then. The graphics weren’t as spiffy as those in Call of Duty 4, but the creativity and complexity of these games is awesome. Also, since these games are so old, most of them are available as free abandonware! Some famous classic DOS game titles include the text based game trilogy “ZORK” and the 3D shooting game “DOOM”. The key to using MS-DOS is a nifty emulator called DOSBox. DOSBox is a popular open source DOS emulator that lets you run the actual MS-DOS on your current PC for free! You’re probably wondering where you can get this cool application, well, the download page and official website is right here: http://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1 As you can see, DOSBox is available on all well known operating systems and even some lesser known ones. Download the one for your OS.           DOSBox on Windows   Chances are that once you download it, you will open it up and think “What the heck?” but don’t be discouraged by the command line interface! I’ll help you master it and use it to play a great classic game. Let’s go through the process of downloading and playing the game DOOM.           DOOM logo   First off, we need to download the game files. A great DOS game archive can be found at http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/. DOOM can be found at http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/doom/ (scroll to the bottom and click the link to DOOM.zip) Secondly, drag the DOOM folder to your desktop (it can be placed elsewhere, but the desktop is good for ease of use!). Thirdly, assuming that you put that folder on your desktop, open up DOSBox and type “mount c ~/desktop/doom” I am using Mac so your file directories may be different or the same depending on your OS (change them accordingly!). Next, type “c:” This is where the directions start to become game/app specific. Since we are using doom, type “install” and go through the install process (you want to use the C drive and if it asks you if you want to create a directory, say yes). Just choose all of the defaults, and after the setup, type”doom” (this launches doom.exe) to start the game (if the game doesn’t start by itself). TIPS/TRICKS:   use the commands “dir” and “cd” to navigate through your computer’s file system (“dir” lists files in current directory, “cd” followed by a folder name or file path will change the current directory to the specified directory)  to launch or open a file, type “dir” and look for the name of the EXE file. Type the name of the EXE file and it will launch!","categories": ["Software"],

        "excerpt":"6 years ago, creating and maintaining a wiki was complicated. It required complex software that only a person proficient in the web development field could manage. Thus the birth of a great little project dubbed “PeanutButterWiki” or “PBWiki” for short.The developers thought that setting up a wiki should be “as easy as making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.” It enabled users to quickly and easily set up a small wiki without the complications of sophisticated software and hosting. 48 hours after the initial release, over 1,000 wikis had been created. That’s a LOT! Thrilled by its popularity, the developers decided to pursue the project. It developed more and more advanced features, and the product evolved into a freemium model. That is, it came with great free features for free, and, for a price, additional features could be added to a user’s wiki. In 2009, the developers at PBWiki decided that they wanted to target a business and school audience rather than the average user that used their services for personal use. To make their software sound more appealing, they changed their name to PBWorks. I, personally, love PBWorks and have used it for dozens of projects and websites over the years. My rating of the service: 9/10           PBWorks Logo   They still support using their great software for personal use, but it isn’t advertised much.

The new iMacs feature:   Thunderbolt port  HD webcam  Intel Core i5/i7 Sandy Bridge architecture                    New iMac               The new Thunderbolt port was first introduced in the recent release of the new Macbook Pro, and it is blazingly fast. When I say fast, I mean that it has a 10GB/second data transfer speed! WOW! That&#8217;s 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and 20 times faster than with USB 2.0!           The HD webcam allows you to record or stream 720p video. Apple advertises using it for HD FaceTime video calls.           The Intel Core i5/i7 processor is &#8220;up to 70% faster&#8221; than its preceding generation. This makes for faster computing that is clearly noticeable when working with applications such as Mathematica or Final Cut Studio.           Overall, the new iMac doesn&#8217;t bring too many new features, but the few that it does are awesome! If you already have the previous generation iMac, than there isn&#8217;t much of a reason to update for the new features (unless, of course, you are working with some CPU intensive programs).

        "excerpt":"          Grooveshark Widgets Page   NOTE: Grooveshark embedding has changed since the publishing of this tutorial! Just follow the instructions here. We recently reviewed the website Grooveshark.com. For a quick recap, Grooveshark allows users to listen to almost any song for free. You can listen to each song an unlimited amount of times, you can organize your favorite songs into playlists, and you can listen the Grooveshark Radio (similar to Pandora.com). It also includes many social aspects such as following people and simple share functionality. One lesser known feature is that you can embed individual songs or playlists into your blog, website, an email, or even your PBWorks wiki! There are two ways of accomplishing this:   Go to widgets.grooveshark.com and select either the playlist or single song option. Adjust the appearance  settings as you like, and then search for songs that you would like to be included in the widget (this option is on the second option page for playlists, and the first for single song). After the completion of these settings, Grooveshark will provide you with an embed code. If you are unfamiliar with HTML or embedding, do a simple Google search for embedding content on the platform that you wish to include your widget.  Find the desired song in the list view and hover your mouse over it. Click the down arrow that appears right of the song name column, select “Share Song”, and then select “Widget”. Alternatively, when playing a song, click the gear button that appears above the song queue or on the song item itself. Select “Share Song”, and then select “Widget”. Change the settings if you wish and copy and paste the embed code to your desired website. Do a simple Google search for embedding content on the platform that you wish to include your widget if you are unfamiliar with the process. If you want to use the contents of  one of your playlists as a widget, simply navigate to your playlist and click the button at the top that is labeled “Share Playlist”. Choose widget, change the settings to your likings, and copy and paste the embed code to your website.

        "title": "Unity3D",
        "excerpt":"Most video game developers require a solid game engine to make a successful game (I say most due to the fact Zork is a text-based adventure and is quite popular). But the big game developers develop their own engines for their own uses such as Epic Games and the Unreal Engine. The Unreal Engine is something spectacular, but not for all uses. Small gaming companies and even individual gamers tend to use other types of Game Engines. Unity3D is one of these game engines used by many of the individual developers and small time developers. And for good reason. Unity3D has an apotheosis of versatility; it can be used to mobile games and computer games. It requires commonly used programming languages; Python, Java, and Boo (a Python dialect). Many developers have been using Unity3D. The developers behind the iPhone apps Battle Bears, Air Attack, Age of Curling and Ravensword: The Fallen King have used Unity3D to make their apps spectacular. The full list is on the website. If you were to check it out, you would notice that Unity3D is not limited to iPhone, but includes Android, Desktop, and Website-related games. The main reason for the popularity, is not only the programming not a convoluted mess of languages, and so is the actual graphics development. It is a straightforward path to creating a game. Though I say this, it is not for those who just want to pick up a program and build iPhone apps. It requires some previously acquired skills. But for those programmers looking for an alternative solution, or those who are willing to learn a new platform to expand their knowledge, this is the way to go. It is a very useful tool, and should be used, if one does not have a better option. I add one more topic to this Unity3D post. My admin reminded me of a key factor that makes Unity3D so plausible. It is the fact it has a slimmed down free-version that is good for trying out, and if you want to try out Unity3D to experience the awesomeness, you should check out the free-version before upgrading it. Just thought I’d throw that in.           Unity3D   ","categories": ["Software"],

Well, we cannot progress any further till you have mastered the Hello World! program. You will be punished if progressing without consulting Hello World. Let’s take a look at the coding for Hello World! Note that the HTML is in the strange font and the Javascript is bolded. **&lt;script type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&gt;**  **document.write(&#8220;Hello World!&#8221; )**  **&lt;/script&gt;**&lt;/HTML**&gt;**&nbsp;You HTML programmers would understand the basic template for creating a Body and Heading and all that happiness. But once you look at the Javascript, you&#8217;ll realize that using the function provided is just wasting your time. And that is true. **document.write** makes no difference, even if you were using just HTML to write &#8220;Hello World.&#8221; You should realize **document.write** will only make your life easier if you plan to use more Javascript.&nbsp;Another way of displaying &#8220;Hello World&#8221; on your Hello World! document is by creating a box so that when one types in &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; it will display, Hello World!**&lt;SCRIPT Language =&#8221;JavaScript&#8221; &gt;****function MsgBox (textstring) {****alert (textstring) }****&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;** ******&lt;INPUT Name =&#8221;text1&#8243; TYPE=text&gt;****&lt;INPUT Name=&#8221;submit&#8221;TYPE=Button VALUE=&#8221;Show Me&#8221; onclick=&#8221;MsgBox(&#8220;hello World!&#8221; )&#8221; &gt;**&lt;/HTML**&gt;**&nbsp;This allows the user to just type in his what-not and display it. We are hoping this person will type &#8220;Hello World&#8221; and not something obscene.You may notice the other part of the Javascript has some strange inputs and names and other pieces of information that seem convoluted at the moment (if it doesn&#8217;t, you are either lying, know Javascript already, or just are very observant; I am guessing the third one).

        "excerpt":"Wow. Physics games happen to be the best selling throughout the iPhone App store. Well, they do have pigs getting splattered or feeding chubby little monsters with candy gumballs, I mean who doesn’t see the appeal. But it could be a bit difficult to find good puzzle games through all the look-alikes, or you might want to learn more about them. Here are the top 10 best selling iPhone Physics Puzzle games as well as some very interesting physics games. 1. Angry Birds Price: $0.99 Developer: Rovio Mobile    2. Cut the Rope   Price: $0.99   Developer: Chillingo Ltd   This little app is all about feeding a gumball to a little monster. I guess it combined the simplistic element of Angry Birds with the a different physics strategy. Most have heard about it, for it was the first app to oust Angry Birds from its throne at the top of the iPhone Apps development list.   3. Peggle   Price: $2.99   Developer: PopCap Games   A personal favorite. Peggle is an interesting game, that involves unicorns, rainbows, and happy music that would serve as the theme for Pretty Princess II &#8211; The Return of the Prettier Princess. Most manly guys wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead playing a unicorn game. But the explosions, cool gizmos on the sides of the playing course that don&#8217;t do anything, and other animals that tell you what to do just make the game so appealing. You should definitely try this one out.     4. Labyrinth 1&amp;2   Cost: $2.99 &#8211; $4.99   Developer: Illusion Labs   Labyrinth has always been a popular board game. But now it has lasers, wheels, holes that do stuff, and many more gadgets that make the game more entertaining. Along with Peggle, I rank this is a must have.   5. Tiki Tower   Price: $0.99   Developer: GameHouse   A game where you have monkeys that cross a certain area by constructing a bridge. The challenge? You have a limited supply of bamboo sticks and the monkeys have a tendency to destroy whatever you build. It is quite interesting, but after sometime, can become quite annoying.   6. iBlast Moki   Price: $2.99   Developer: Godzilab   People love this game. I find it semi-amusing. It is interesting, and a very good physics puzzler. You have little Mokis and all you do with them is launch into swirling vortexes with a bomb.           Gameplay     7. Topple &amp; Topple 2   Price: Free to $0.99   Developer: Ngmoco Inc.   Topple and Topple 2 are probably the simplest of games on this list. The entire point of the game is to stack up blocks as high as you can. Saying that, you should check out the free version. Not everyone loves it, but you try it. If you find the free version amusing, there is no need for the paid version (not much of a difference).   8. Enigmo   Price: $0.99   Developer: Pangea   Not for everyone, and I do find it bit overrated. But it isn&#8217;t in the 8th place because it is bad. It is in the 8th place because it joined in the 8-way tie for 8th. With that being said, Enigmo is one of the most downloaded games of all time. It has very interesting gameplay; guide droplets of water, oil, and fire into different, specified pots. There are plenty of different tools you can use to manipulate the water/oil/fire, and this make the gameplay more diverse.      9. Toy Physics/Crayon Physics/Finger Physics   Price: $0.99   Developer: Various developers worked on these games separately   This games follow a similar theme. Using parts to make something happen. In Toy Physics, you guide toys using several different aspects of physics (hydraulics, pulleys, ropes&#8230;) into the moving crates. Finger Physics, downloaded over 5 million times, requires the moving of shapes, and is two-dimensional. Crayon Physics is my favorite of the three, and uses a two-dimensional plane of crayon drawing to make a certain scenario complete.   10. Aqua Forest   Price: $4.99   Developer: Hudson   Hudson can have an entire category of Physics gaming to themselves, but Aqua Forest is one of the most prolific. The point of the game is to calm oneself as they move water from a Point A to a Point B. It is a bit difficult to classify, so I encourage one to check out this one, especially if they are a bit tense.   So as I conclude the top 10 list, I must say that these apps, are not in order of best to worst, nor worst to best. It is judged by its versatility, enjoyability, less stress inducing, calming, and a plethora of other complicated matters. With that being said, I am open to any suggestions, and maybe I might talk about other Physics puzzles. I hope you enjoyed the article! ","categories": ["App Review","iOS"],

        "title": "Microsoft Acquires Skype",
        "excerpt":" Microsoft just purchased wildly popular video conferencing platform Skype for a whopping 8.5 billion USD! Microsoft probably doesn’t have making money off of it in mind, at least directly. Skype is still not turning a profit as of the takeover. Instead, it is likely that Microsoft will include Skype technology in its many products, including the XBOX 360, Messenger, Outlook, Windows phone, and Hotmail. In addition, Microsoft has lacked a presence on the internet lately and Microsoft may hope to keep up with companies such as Facebook and Google. In purchasing Skype, Microsoft adopts 170 million+ happy users. What will this mean for non-microsoft products and platforms such as Macintosh? Well, Steve Ballmer, the CEO of Microsoft, has the following to say on the subject:   “We will continue to support non-Microsoft platforms, because it’s fundamental to the value proposition of communications . . . We obviously love Windows, and we love Windows Phone, and we love the Xbox, and we’re going to do a lot of work together to design these things and optimise the work that we do across the device, the operating system and the communications software, no question about it. But, fundamental to the value proposition of communications is being able to reach everybody, whether they happen to be on your device or not. And I think that, in fact, will be one of our competitive advantages, both for the Skype communications services, and in fact, for the devices as we move forward.” Behind the cheesy publicity message, it is likely that Microsoft will continue Skype support for platforms like Macintosh simply because they want to continue profiting from a large user database of 8 million+  users that pay for Skype services. It is probable that there won’t be any product changes for a while, as Microsoft still needs to deal with regulatory issues and other business related complications. That is, it will be some time before we see if this Skype takeover is going to swim or sink. I really hope that Microsoft makes good decisions with Skype and really does continue to support all the platforms that it currently does. Skype is a very well done service, and it woud be a shame if Microsoft destroyed it. ","categories": ["Hot News"],

        "title": "YouTube Released A Movie Rental Service",
        "excerpt":" As of May 9, if you head on over to http://www.youtube.com/movies you will see YouTube’s shiny, new movie rental service. Google announced the new service in a blog post on Monday, saying   “Today, we’re announcing another step in our goal to bring more of the video you love to YouTube: the addition of thousands of full-length feature films from major Hollywood studios available to rent in the US at youtube.com/movies. In addition to the hundreds of free movies available on the site since 2009, you will be able to find and rent some of your favorite films.” The going rental prices are $3.99 for new movies, and $2.99 for old ones. The video library of movies available for rent consists of 3,000 major Hollywood films, including ones such as “Despicable Me”, “Inception”, and “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”. In addition to this massive collection, YouTube will continue to provide the 3,000 video library of free movies. This brings the total number of full-length films available on YouTube to well above 6,000! Upon purchasing a movie rental, you will have 30 days to start watching it. Once you start it, you will have 24 hours to complete watching it, and then your rental will expire. Google’s goals for their new movie service no doubt include competing with movie rental and purchase companies Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. Also, this is yet another attempt by Google to turn a profit with YouTube.           YouTube's movie rental homepage   ","categories": ["Hot News"],

The game is available as a free WebGL game , and it offers both standard definition and high definition graphics.

        "title": "Top 10 iPhone Games &#8211; Ported iPhone Games",
        "excerpt":"Ported iPhone Games is a term for games that were intended for other platforms (such as PC) but translated over to iPhone. Here are some of the most prolific and somewhat most entertaining iPhone Ports.   1. The Secret of Monkey Island Price: $7.99 Developer: LucasArts The game that defined Point-and-click games. This game includes humor as well as adventure, with quite entertaining cartoons. I believe every fan of Point-and-Click games should get a copy of this. The only hesitation one would come across, is the steep price tag for such an app. I encourage one to try out the free version, and if they like that, they should definitely get the full version. There is also The Secret of Monkey Island II out, for fans of the original.  2. The Sims 3 Price: Varies ($0.99 to $6.99) Developer: Electronic Arts Note: Electronic Art ported most of their own games over to iPhone, and could probably fill up an entire list of their own apps, but that would defeat the purpose of creating a varied iPhone Apps list? Right? This is a very dimmed down version of The Sims 3, but nonetheless contains many of the aspects that the original, PC version had. The iPhone’s processor cannot withhold that much of a burden that the Original Sims 3 would boast upon it. The iPhone version is interesting, but once you get used to the game, and complete most of the achievements, it becomes dull and monotonous. You soon find yourself marrying everyone in town, due to lack of other options. If you loved The Sims 3, you may enjoy this game, but it probably won’t stay interesting for more than several weeks (at most). 3. Dragon’s Lair Price: $0.99 – $4.99 Developer: Electronic Arts Yes, I know. I said Electronic Arts already ports games and blah blah blah about having a category for themselves. I never said that they don’t deserve some spots on the list! Ha! I found a loophole with what I said! Yes! Oh wait. What was I talking about? Oh yeah! Dragon’s Lair. I’m not old enough to pull one of the “I remember in my day we used to play Dragon’s Lair and it cost me so many quarters I found meself acting homeless just so I could play one more game,” but I can say that Dragon’s Lair is a pretty old game. It happened to be one of the most popular games too. That’s why it was ported.           Dirk with Monster     4. Space Invaders Price: $4.99 Developer: Taito Space Invaders. One of the Retro Games, and I am still not old enough to pull off a “Back in my day…” But other than that, Space Invaders still has aspects of one of the old video game machines such as the awful graphics (sorry, no euphemism here) or the fact I just ‘put all my money into a machine and can’t get past level 2.’ But $4.99 (20 quarters for those of you…You know who you are) for this kind of game may seem great for one of y’all who played this as a kid, but with so many other options, I believe it seems unnecessary. 5. Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered Price: $2.99 Developer: Revolution I like this game. It is similar to The Secret of Monkey Island, but instead of taking place with a joyful theme and pirates that drink grog till they’re wasted, it takes place in a future dystopia. Those of you who have played the original version will not be disappointed by this gameplay.           Facing a Dude             Gameplay     6. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars Price: $6.99 to $9.99 Developer: Rockstar Games I don’t like this game that much. The point is to sell drugs, buy guns, shoot Asians, steal cars, and repeat process. But other than my opinion, people seem to enjoy this game often (I guess people like to get their anger out on cartoons). I don’t have much more to say about this. I only included this so I don’t get yelled at. A pretty macho thing to do, right? 7. Monopoly, Scrabble, Catan, Etc. Price: Various Developers: Various (mostly Electronic Arts) Okay, these aren’t exactly ports, but say what you will. I believe them to be ports of the original video game; The non-existant one. But other then that, I find two flaws with board games:       The computer stacks the game so it is either in favor of you or itself         The randomness of the game is not really “random.” It is more of a series of probabilities that the programmers had to come up with (you can’t simulate randomness).   But I am not complaining. The programmers behind it put a lot of effort and are begging to be rewarded.   8. Plants vs. Zombies Price: $2.99 Developer: PopCap Games PopCap ported all their games over. Peggle, Chuzzle, and Bejeweled. I just don’t see the appeal of Bejeweled (well, actually I do…I just get bored of Bejeweled), Peggle is nice, and Chuzzle is…interesting. But Plants vs. Zombies is PopCap’s best game they ported over. If you haven’t gotten ahold of one, I recommend buying it. 9. Peggle Price: $2.99 Developer: PopCap Games Someone mention Peggle? I did! Yay! Peggle! Yay! Not much else to say. 10. Chaos Rings Price: $12.99 Developer: Square Enix Chaos Rings is one of the best RPG/Adventure games ever to hit the App store. I put it in 10th because I am saving the best for last. There are so many great things about the game that I’d find myself being repeatedly tagged “Mr. Obvious.” If you check 1 game out, it should be this one.

        "title": "Macintosh Garden &#8211; Great Mac Abandonware Archive!",
        "excerpt":" Fist off, you must either have an old iMac with Mac OS 9 or earlier installed, a PowerPC running Mac OS 10.1 or 10.2 (those initial versions of Mac OS 10 included MAc OS 9 support!), or simply a copy of Mac OS 9 or earlier (if need be, you can try to find one on Macintosh Garden) if you want to make any use of Macintosh Garden. If you are running on a newer machine and have gotten your hands (or cursor) on a copy of a classic version of the Mac OS, head on over to http://basilisk.cebix.net/ or http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/ for a great Mac emulator! With that said, Macintosh Garden is the best classic Macintosh abandonware archive website on the web! It boasts 1000+ classic applications, including games, utilities, browsers, and many more apps that fall under other categories. It organizes user uploaded content that has been verified as abandonware, and allows anyone to start downloading classic software after a simple signup. Why would you want to do this? Well, same reasons as mentioned in our post about DOSBox. That is, to fix those feelings of nostalgia (for those that played games back in the days of Mac Classic), or simply to enjoy playing some of the greatest games ever made. All of this is available for free in the form of abandonware (as mentioned above). For those unfamiliar with the term, abandonware is software that was abandoned by its author and released for free (usually due to the loss of popularity of a software platform). Also, as said on the Macintosh Garden website, “Another reason is that people realize that all these new “cool” 3D games already have been made. And usually the original is more fun to play.” For example, The Secret of Monkey Island and all versions of DOOM are available titles on Macintosh Garden. What are you waiting for?!? Oh ya… that’s right…. here’s the link: http://www.macintoshgarden.org/ Enjoy!       ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Gaming"],

        "title": "Unhearit &#8211; get that DAMN song out of your head with this nifty website!",
        "excerpt":" On August 26th of 2010, a man by the name of Tony Gines had a bright idea. This idea was simple, yet not implemented on any other website. This idea was “Unhearit”. What “Unhearit” does is “help you get that damn song out of your head” by playing another that replaces it. He probably didn’t expect much out of his website, and was shocked to find that Unhear.it got over 2,000,000 hits in a mere two months! I was one of those 2 million. I was fortunate enough to be able to watch Unhearit slowly develop from a shaky launch to a viral service. Back when it was new, it played a smaller selection of songs (some of which are now removed due to copyright issues), and its domain was Unhear.it. Now, Unhearit boasts an uncountable number of songs, has released a mobile app for iOS, and has changed its domain from Unhear.it to Unhearit.com. Another surprising characteristic of Unhearit is that the entire website consists of only one page. That’s ONE single page, and already Unhearit.com has reached the rank of 521,417 on Alexa. Wow.

        "title": "Top 10 iPhone Games &#8211; Role Playing Games",
        "excerpt":"RPG Games are quite prolific and there are a million of them on the app store. It may be hard to sift through them to find the best RPG games, so here is a list of my favorites. 1. Chaos Rings Price: $12.99 Developer: Square Enix Chaos Rings is arguably one of the best RPG Games out there. It plays similarly to Final Fantasy, and is created by the same company. The reasons I list this as the best RPG game are the following: It has great graphics, the story is excellent….You get the picture. The only downside of this app is its large price tag.           Excellent Graphics + Awesomeness     2. Crimson Gem Saga Price: $9.99 Developer: Nate Games This game does not compare to Chaos Rings in the quality of graphics, but still has very good cartoon graphics. As you can see, RPG games cost a lot more money than other games, due to the depth of story and hours of gameplay…I find myself advertising this app rather than reviewing it. If you choose between Crimson Gem Saga and Chaos Rings, the latter is far superior. Try this out if you don’t want Chaos Rings. 3. Dungeon Hunter Price: $4.99 Developer: Gameloft I feel like Gameloft makes intentionally cliche games and/or copies other games and dumbs the game down a bit. But Dungeon Hunter was a pretty decent game despite the fact Gameloft has a tendency to “rush” their games. It has good graphics, as well as a certain complexity to the game that is not too annoying, but not too easy. 4. Necromancer Rising Price: $3.99 Developer: RyanMitchellGames.com Necromancer Rising is a grotesque game. It uses a graphics engine called SouL EnginE. This engine is not like the average, polished graphics, but then again, if it had those “polished graphics” it may not suit the game as the developers wanted it too. If you like nightmarish RPG games, this is a quite interesting game to try out.     5. Across AgePrice: $2.99 Developer: FDG Entertainment Across Age brings back those graphics with those tiny little cartoon figures that could only move in 4 directions. Who doesn’t love those? Lots of people. But other then the fact people have opinions (Gosh darn it, people!) it is still a quite nice game. It doesn’t have the full length of most of the RPG games listed above, but it is good for those of you who do not want to spend $13 on a game that you just may not enjoy. 6. Inotia  &amp; Inotia 2 Price: $0.99 – $2.99 Developer: Com2Us Inotia is similar to Across Age, but I liked it less. Just a personal preference. Other then that, it is just a standard RPG game with a different storyline. 7. Ravensword: The Fallen King Price: $2.99 Developer: Chillingo Ltd. Chillingo is one of the most prolific iPhone Game Developers, similar to Gameloft. Ravensword: The Fallen King was created to counterbalance Dungeon Hunter. Dungeon Hunter, as you can see, got a higher rating from me, and here is my justification. Ravensword has a great sandbox style of gameplay. You can adventure through your land and complete the story without having to follow a specific path. But it’s frame rate gets messed up during gameplay and can be somewhat glitchy from time-to-time. Dungeon Hunter, though it has a specific path of gameplay, does not have the problem listed above. Other then that, Ravensword is a good RPG game and you should try it out, if you have been taking good care of your iOS device.                     Very Nice Graphics, as you can see         8. Aralon Sword and ShadowPrice: $4.99 Developer: Crescent Moon Games I like this game a lot. It is quite realistic in its gameplay, and has good graphics considering the iPhone being what it is. Here are some of its features straight from the iTunes description: – Cloud Save: Save your game progress and access it on multiple IOS devices – Full Retina Display and iPad Support – Over 30 hours of gameplay – Gorgeous and dynamic 3d environments – 3rd and First Person play modes – Full Day/Night cycle and dynamic lighting effects – Epic Soundtrack and realistic sound effects – Customizable characters, including hairstyles, armor, and different faces – 4 Character Classes – Unique Skill Trees for each class – 3 Playable Races: Humans, Elves, and Trolls – A primary quest and multiple, optional side-quests – Hundreds of items to acquire and wield – Comprehensive Inventory System – Battle various enemies that use different fighting tactics – Faction system, herb gathering, crafting potions and magical items, dual-wielding, lockpicking, pick-pocketing, and more – Swimming, Fishing, Campfires – 8 Different Mount Types, including horses, dragons, and more – Fully animated 3d characters – Achievements – Pets and henchmen to help you in your quests – Save system with 6 different save slots     9. The Quest   Price: $4.99 Developer: Chillingo Ltd The Quest uses old style graphics. The Quest uses a first-person perspective. It follows the basic RPG format of collecting items and using them as well as leveling up. It was one of the earliest RPG games to hit the iOS App Store.   10. UnderworldsPrice: $0.99 Developer: Pixel Mine Inc. Underworlds is also an early RPG game to hit the App Store. The graphics are very old school, as well as the gameplay. The actual storyline follows a thriller/horror basis, which makes the game more enjoyable.                     Old School Gameplay               &nbsp;           I hope you found this list useful!

From MySpace to Facebook to Formspring to Twitter to Tumblr, Social Networks surround us infinitely. 500 million+ people use Facebook. That is 1/12 the world’s population! Ning here lets you get in on Social Network creation. Ning doesn’t create the next Facebook, but it creates sites that have a large amount of Social Networking that is devoted to a single cause. An example would be a famous movie-star or TV Show that generates a huge fan-base. These fanatics band together in a social network and, you know, do whatever fans do. But it isn’t limited to just celebrities or big-time products. I could create a Ning devoted to myself and my awesomeness. I would probably get like 3 fans or something. I probably won’t do this, but you get the picture. It groups people together through a common interest in some sort of media. As to be expected of any professional web service, Ning isn’t free. It used to be, but after a new CEO stepped in, an awful decision was made. Namely, to cut their free services and focus on their premium services. The cheapest option is $2.95 Monthly, with upgrades available. Check out plans and pricing if you are interested. The other great aspect of Ning is the fact one can generate revenue off of their Social Network.

        "excerpt":"Many consider C++ to be cliche and a bit ancient. But nonetheless, it is great for beginners who want to start programming, but don’t know where to start. If you learn C or C++, Objective-C becomes much easier to learn. And believe us, Objective-C is not for beginner programmers. Before you get started programming in C++, you should have a IDE.

        "title": "Top 5 MMORPGs For iOS",
        "excerpt":"      We recently reviewed the top 10 RPGs for iOS, and I think it fitting to now do a list on the top 5 MMORPGs (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games). In these games, you play a character that interacts with other players from around the globe in a virtual world. Sounds crazy, right?           1. Pocket Legends (3d MMO)           Price: Free with in-app purchases to unlock areas and items           Developer: Spacetime Studios, LLC                      As you start the game you will be asked to choose one of three classes. Each class has its own advantages and disadvantages. The game itself consists of venturing through many dungeons and other areas in the process of completing hundreds of quests. In addition to completing quests, you can compete in player vs. player tournaments. The virtual world is composed of many towns, and within each town is a portal. These portals lead you to the dungeons and forests where most of the gameplay occurs. Overall, the map is fairly large. Each player can advance at certain skills and friend one another. Another feature that makes this MMORPG different from others is the incorporation of playing in groups, or &#8220;parties&#8221;. In fact, it is almost impossible to complete levels and quests without playing in groups! All in all, Pocket Legends is an impressive MMORPG for all iOS devices that has highly respectable graphics, MANY hours of gameplay, and many original features.           2.Yslandia MMORPG           Price: Free           Developer: Bulkypix           First off, I think it worth mentioning that this game used to be $4.99, I believe that that says a lot about the quality of this game and the effort that went into it. Also, you Game Center users will be glad to hear that Yslandia supports&#8230; uh&#8230; Game Center. In addition, the game:                 incorporates an overwhelming amount of quests              is 2d              allows for the creation of more than one character              has multiple player classes              supports guilds (clans)              has a fairly developed skill level system              The only negative qualities of Yslandia that I have noticed are come of the graphics, a sometime slow gameplay, and the incredibly small amount of online players at any given time.           Overall, it&#8217;s a pretty cool game and, since it&#8217;s free, what have you got to lose from trying it?           3. Order &amp; Chaos Online           Price: $6.99 + monthly subscription of $.99 for a month, $1.99 for three months, or $2.99 for six months           Developer: Gameloft                      Order &amp; Chaos Online is basically a fairly well made World of Warcraft clone. It has great controls, beautiful 3D graphics, and enough hardcore gameplay to keep you occupied for many, MANY hours. That&#8217;s all there really is to say.           4. The World of Magic           Price: Freemium (pay to unlock areas and items)           Developer: Com2uS Inc.           Like Yslandia, The World of Magic has impressive 2D graphics. When you start playing, you are given the option of three classes: archer, warrior, and mage. Each of these classes sports an large skill level system, and unique abilities. Gameplay largely involves PVP fights, exploring a massive world, and wandering through endless dungeons while fighting monsters. Other fun features include guilds and parties.           5. Anrufen Online           Price: Free with in-app purchases to unlock areas           Developer: WISTONE ENTERTAINMENT CO LTD           Similar to Order &amp; Chaos Online, Anrufen isn&#8217;t for casual players. It requires dedication to get anywhere. As for graphics, all objects are presented as 2D sprites and most textures are high quality. You play the game from an isometric point of view. When you begin playing, you can become a wizard or a warrior. Gameplay consists of fighting many monsters alongside other players, or going all-out PVP.           Some other games that didn&#8217;t quite make it on the list:                 GraalOnline Classic              Outer Empires              SevenSwords (This one is pretty darn good!)

NaClBox allows you to play DOS games right in your Chrome browser by means of a new feature in Google Chrome called “Native Client” (Read more about Native Client). Native Client isn’t activated by default, so you will need to type “about:flags” into the address bar  while in Chrome and click the enable link under “Native Client”.

        "excerpt":" We’ve all been there, you visit a website that requires you to sign up with a valid email address and you don’t want to give them your real one, or maybe you are just sick of setting up email accounts and want a temporary receive-only one. In some cases, BugMeNot might do the trick for quick and easy access to a website, but sometimes you would rather just sign up with a throw-away email address. Mailinator.com recognizes this dilemma and has a solution. Mailinator allows users to receive emails sent to any @mailinator.com email address. All you have to do is sign up for a website or share your mailinator email address and all mail sent to that address can be found at youraddress.mailinator.com where ” youraddress” is the username part of the email address. The obvious con is that all mail will be public. While this is so, you can make it near private by choosing a very original username and taking advantage of Mailinator’s  alternate inbox names. The alternate inbox name of any address can be found right above the inbox of that address. It looks something like “Alternate Address for this Inbox:  M8R-0rnf9k@mailinator.com”. If you give this email out instead of the direct address, only you will know the username of the inbox. Another cool feature of Mailinator is the widget maker. This allows you to make a useful widget that you can embed into any website or into your iGoogle homepage. Check out Mailinator @ www.mailinator.com ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Email"],

        "title": "Make your own group social network with Wall.FM (Oxwall)",
        "excerpt":"Similar to social network creator Ning, Wall.fm allows you to construct your own social network without any prior web programming knowledge. Wall.fm is the simply the hosted version of an open source social networking software called Oxwall (similar to how wordpress.com is the hosted version of the wordpress.org software which this blog runs on). Wall.fm has free hosting options and paid ones, which you will need to decide upon based upon the features you want. With that said, this post will actually be about the Oxwall software. Oxwall was released as beta software on August 4, 2010. Back then, it was a VERY simple community software with one theme and only featured the following plugins: blogs, groups, links, photos, and videos. Very bare bones. Since then, Oxwall has matured greatly, and now includes 5 complex themes, 49 plugins, and a much more stable platform. You can see a demo here with the plain theme.           Oxwall Test Site With Plain Theme   Now that I have given you a brief history lesson on Oxwall, I think that I should describe all of the amazing features that Oxwall has to offer. For the purpose of simplicity, I have composed a list of my favorite features. They are as follows:   simple forum  video platform with embed-only capabilities  photo albums &amp; upload  newsfeed with status updates and news from around the network (has “like” button and allows comments)  blogs with archives and rich text formatting  a link wall/system simliar to Digg  groups with pages, forums, and newsfeed  events (private or public) and RSVP  virtual gifts that users can send one another (customizable by admin)  profile pages with comment wall, activity widgets, and custom widgets  comment walls on all content  custom pages  mailbox (send and receive messages)  user dashboard (customizable)  friends  user roles  Facebook connect (to login and share content cross-platform)  instant chat (only if self hosting or with premium wall.fm plans)  user credits  contact importer for Google, Facebook, and Yahoo  send and receive email notifications  status updates  5 themes  custom CSSWhew! That’s a LOT! That list should give you an idea on whether or not Oxwall will suit your needs. I have successfully made numerous community websites on Wall.fm. I  have found that it is usually an easy experience and that it should be used to focus on specific groups of people (clubs, people who play a certain game, a hobby, etc.) rather than a general social network. If you are interested in making a divine social network using the Oxwall software, here are the links: http://www.oxwall.org/ (software) http://wall.fm/ (hosted) As always, enjoy!

        "excerpt":"Jonathan Coulton is “a musician, a singer-songwriter and an internet superstar” who, back in September of 2005, decided to start a “thing a week” campaign. This campaign consisted of him recording a new song every week and releasing it for free on his website. One such song that is believed by many to be the best of the campaign is “Code Monkey”. Inspired by a job he once had writing software, the song details the life of a monkey who works for a company that appears to do business relating to web development. A man by name of Mike Spiff Booth (his website) decided that he would make music videos for some of Jonathan Coulton’s songs. You probably can see where this is going. He made a video to go along with Jonathan’s song “Code Monkey”. The videos that Mike makes consist of a mix of World of Warcraft graphics and some video editing.

        "title": "Top 10 Reasons Why Certain iPhone Games are So Successful",
        "excerpt":"   Before I start writing, I want to say a few things that need to be said. The first being that iPhone Games aren’t successful due to one of these aspects or maybe two. They used a combination of 4+ of these aspects. This leads me to my second statement: This is not a failsafe way to make your games popular (I say your if you are an iOS developer). Many games find a way to become popular despite the fact a majority of games have the following reasons in common. 10. Cost (tied) The cost of an iPhone app has a lot to due with how successful it will become. Angry Birds (Rovio Mobile) became the most prolific iPhone game due to the fact it was only $0.99. As hard as it may seem, to make an app so cheap when you worked your heart and soul into it, it can have very great results. Angry Birds grossed $10 million as of now (this is just an estimate). Games That Are Cheap and Successful: Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, and Tiny Wings 10. Marketing (tied) This is a small aspect, but nonetheless important. If you market an app properly, the results can be phenomenal. Gameloft has a Youtube Channel, Website, Podcast and almost every darn thing out there that can reasonably market its apps with. If you can make a Youtube Channel with aesthetically great views of the iPhone Game/App, it’ll contribute much to its success. Companies with Good Marketing: Gameloft, Chillingo, Rovio 7. Aesthetics Yup. You got to make the game pretty. Or at least have a pretty front so people are drawn to it. I wrote in another article about the software called Unity3D. For those of you who want to make your games look nicer than using OpenGL, use Unity3D. The Graphics have a lot to do with the game’s success. But this isn’t to say you can’t make great graphics using a 2-D plane. You can use other graphics engines that use a 2-D plane. Games With Great Graphics: City of Secrets, Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, Driver, The Secret of Monkey Island, Air Attack 5. Theme (tied) A coherent theme to the game is necessary, as it is in writing and art. If you create a game where you throw paper balls at flying unicorns, you will get a lot of obscene four letter words from disgruntled buyers. But if you make a game where you throw paper balls at co-workers who say four letter words to you…that might draw some attention in. Theme is also important to the actual gameplay. But theme can expand from just various mini-games that add up to one larger game. 5. Creativity – The App Aspect (tied) Wow, I am so dumb. I contradicted myself in public. Well, creativity is not as much as a contradiction as it is a balancing act. You must balance Creativity with Theme Coherence in order to make the game successful. If you make a game that follows a certain theme, but is just throwing monkeys at a stack of pigs in a poorly engineered tower, it is not creative…Rovio will be on you pretty quickly. But if you create, for instance, an RPG game that has a storyline different then the average Japanese game, and has graphics that are also quite creative, the game might just work out for you. This brings me to my next, very conditional point: 3. Storyline (conditional) It is conditional. You see storyline doesn’t apply to all apps. Take Angry Birds or Touchgrind. Both are very successful, but do not have a beefy story. But this brings me to the opposite spectrum: RPG games require creative storylines. If you make them so similar to Zenonia or Inotia or even Chaos Rings, you’ll get a lot “too unoriginal” reviews. But on the other hand, if you make the storyline interesting and most of all, creative and original, the game might work out. But the brings up my other point of this section: 3. Creativity – The Wrapping It Together Aspect (tied) So Creativity is what sets the game apart from all others. If you create an app that is similar to another, what makes you believe your app will be just as successful, if not more? If it is similar, it needs a new angle. For instance it could have better graphics, cheaper cost (I know, redundant, but the parallelism in the sentence had to work out), and/or cleaner user interface. It just needs to have some aspect of it that makes it stand out compared to other iPhone apps. 2. User Friendly/Simplicity/Organized This doesn’t mean make a crappy game and you’ll make millions due to its simple nature. Creative games with beautiful graphics do attract a lot of attention, but if the playing of the game is bulky and awkward, the game won’t succeed. Angry Birds was incredibly successful because the older, technically challenged adults could play the game by a stroke of a finger. An app that is organized, simple interface (not simple gameplay), and redundantly, user friendly, the game will incredibly popular. 1. Hard Work If you stayed with me this long, you are probably thinking “How lame!” But the truth is, working hard on an app to incorporate all the stated aspects would make the game very personal. Gameloft (here is a reason I don’t like them) creates game that are very similar to other games that individual developer or smaller companies poured their hearts and souls into. They have a huge company that busts out games in a month. They may also create games that other large development companies have also made, but that is beside the point. Work hard on your app… You have to be devoted to that though. So with all that being said, I just thought I’d finish with my last remark: iPhone apps aren’t created by incorporating everything I said, or even anything! This is just an analysis of the most popular games. But what I will tell you to do (speaking to developers) is to work hard to make your app successful, but most of all, have a creative and individual idea. Who knows? You may become the next Angry Birds developer…Or even better. ","categories": ["iOS"],

        "title": "Use DropBox For Free File Hosting, Easy Media Sharing, And File Portability!",
        "excerpt":"Dropbox is a freemium service that provides file storage in the cloud and, as the title describes, a lot of other things. Dropbox was created by Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi who had the intentions of creating a unique and stable file sharing platform. The result is this great service! A free service that not only is reliable, but also cross-platform!  Dropbox starts you off with 2 gigabytes of free storage and through referrals, you gain an additional 8 gigabytes of storage to stash your files. If 10 gigabytes doesn’t do it for you, you can gain another 768 megabytes of storage by completing the tasks on https://www.dropbox.com/free. But wait! There’s more! If you complete the starting guide, you get another 250 megabytes of storage.                     Dropbox web interface - It's Just That Awesome               As shown in the image above, Dropbox provides you with a neat web interface for managing your files. Highly functional, it allows you to set file permissions, create photo albums, upload files, download files, and a tsunami of other features.           Yet another unique feature that is incredibly useful is the Dropbox software that you can install on your computer. The software will create a folder on your computer that will appear to be local, but it will actually be your &#8220;Dropbox.&#8221; Just use that folder as you normally would with any folder (add files, remove files, etc.) and it will sync up with your Dropbox account as soon as it can without slowing down your computer or sucking up too much bandwidth. Do this with multiple computers connected to the same Dropbox, and you have a great way to transfer files device-to-device! You can forget about the days of USB flash drives and emailing files to yourself. On a related note, you can choose to share folders with other Dropbox users by setting a folder as &#8220;Shared&#8221; and submitting the email adresses of the other users.           Dropbox is cross-platform. Use it on Macintosh, Windows, an iOS device, Android, Blackberry and the Windows Phone 7 (not saying you own all of the said or some of the said&#8230;). My experience only extends to using it on a Mac and on an iPod, and I have to say that I am impressed with the quality of service.           As you can probably imagine, Dropbox opens a planetoid of possibilities. Some clever uses include using it as a simple website host for your simple website pages (use a URL shortener to make the website more usable), using the shared folder feature to collaborate on group projects, making a game save folder so that you can access your saved games on any computer, and utilizing the sync features in a way that allows you to chat with other people sharing a folder by using a Mac app called Chatbox.           Okay, so you are probably not that excited over Dropbox, but I still encourage you to use it for file hosting and media sharing. It doesn&#8217;t compare with the premium services such as Mozy, but it does suffice for those of you who want to, you know, do stuff. If your focus is on project collaboration, be sure to consider using PBworks (it too allows for 2 gigabytes of file storage!)           Sign up for Dropbox&#8217;s amazing services here (or our referral link&#8211; you get an extra 250 megabytes, I get another 250 megabytes. Win-win.)                         Yeah??

        "title": "Centralize Your Workflow And Files With a Web Desktop!",
        "excerpt":"A web desktop (or “webtop” for short) is a web application that simulates a desktop environment. Web desktops are ideal for:   accessibility (connect to from anywhere with internet access)  online file storage and organization  a simple virus-free work environment  a great browser start pageTo make the best out of your experience with webtops, I suggest using the fullscreen options (look in the “View” menu) available in Google Chrome and Firefox. Many companies have released products that are unique takes on web desktops. Some of them are more traditional; they try to replicate a popular OS like Windows or Mac. Others have developed their own one-of-a-kind interfaces with media and news aggregators. Here are some of the best web desktop services from around the web, in no particular order:   Glide    Let me start off by saying that Glide OS allows you to store 30 gigabytes of data on your web desktop for free, which is quite impressive. That’s fifteen times the amount allowed by a free Dropbox account! Glide also offers three different interfaces to choose from. Two of them, “Desktop” and “Glide HD”, incorporate many characteristics of the Windows desktop environment. The third, “Portal”, offers a tabbed interface that has a focus of bookmarking and information aggregation. All of these interfaces have a customizable background wallpaper. In addition to these desktop interfaces, Glide provides a simple mobile device interface. Applications that come bundled with Glide include a calendar, a photo editor, an email client, a rich text editor, a slideshow presentation builder (similar to Microsoft’s PowerPoint), a music player, a video player, a photo viewer, a photo editor, a simple drawing utility, stickies, an address book, a calculator, bookmark organizer, RSS feed reader (so you can read the Byte Revel RSS feed!), a website builder, and a microblogging and collaboration tool called “Engage”. All in all, I have to say that Glide OS is a great web desktop. The interface bugs me somewhat, but the service is feature-rich (which totally makes up for it) and is good for cloud storage. Check out Glide @ http://www.glidedigital.com/   eyeOS eyeOS (“iOS” much?) sports a clean interface with a well organized file system. You can choose between the “Classic Desktop” and the “Dashboard” interface in the system preferences. “Classic desktop” is similar to Windows, and “Dashboard” is… well.. like a dashboard. The dashboard is divided into a selected number of columns, each containing widgets of varying types. Another customization possible with both interfaces is a custom desktop wallpaper. I think that it is also important to point out that eyeOS has a mobile device friendly interface. Applications are pretty generic yet well done in eyeOS. They include a very functional rich text editor, a complete and organized calendar, a mail client, a simple text editor, a calculator, and a chat (useful only to chat with other eyeOS users). As for built in utilities, you get an elegant music and video player. One of the apparent focuses of eyeOS is group collaboration, as you are easily able to share files and folders. In addition, you may create groups (public or private) that other eyeOS users can join. As far as file storage goes, you get 2 gigabytes of storage space and, as mentioned above, there is a well organized file system. Check out eyeOS @ http://eyeos.org/   Cloudo    Cloudo does a great job of simulating the desktop environment of Windows, Macintosh, and even Linux. It even allows you to choose the version of the operating system that you want to simulate! A default Cloudo theme is also offered. Beyond theme customization, Cloudo allows you to choose icon sets and have a custom desktop wallpaper. All of this results in an aesthetically pleasing graphic user interface. Cloudo is fairly limited when it comes to applications. You can utilize, among a few other applications, a text editor, a calendar, a paint application, a contact manager, a web browser, a media player, a RSS reader, and games such as “Minesweeper” and “Connect Four”. Another feature that is technically an application is a command line interface window. Lastly, A unique feature relating to applications in Cloudo is that anyone can develop applications for the platform and publish them. Check out Cloudo @ http://cloudo.com/   myGOYA    When I first opened up myGOYA for the first time, I thought to myself “Woah… a Macintosh dock at the top of the screen and the windows look identical to Windows windows?”. That pretty much summarizes the graphic user interface. The focus of myGOYA seems to be community. There is community based sharing, user-to-user private messaging, chat, blogging, etc. One thing I noticed about myGOYA was the large amount of applications and features.These include bookmarks, chat, Flickr search, notes, a well made word processing application, a media player, an email client, a calendar, contact management, and much more. If you were hoping to make a cloud drive out of this, you are mostly out of luck. You are only given 512 megabytes of storage (which isn’t all that bad, but also doesn’t stand as competition to the alternatives). Check out myGOYA @ http://www.mygoya.de/   CloudMe The developers over at Xcerion were aiming for a webtop that served as a fancy cloud drive. Because of this, they offer you 3 gigabytes of storage, an iOS native app, and a neat webtop. File organization is really well done, with folders for music, photos, and videos. Sharing files is a fairly easy task. Applications are centered around accesing your files and sharing them. That is, there is a photo viewing application, an application for listening to your music, an application for watching your videos, an email client (oh, and you get a free @cloudme email address when you sign up), and a chat application with MSN support. Check out CloudMe @ http://www.cloudme.com/   Netvibes    The Netvibes interface is centered around dashboards. You can make multiple dashboards, and put an unlimited amount of widgets on each dashboard. These widgets can be of almost anything you can think of (email, comics, weather, news, RSS, etc.). If there isn’t a widget already made for it, you can create your own widget by simply choosing a widget type (there are A LOT and, if for some reason the widget that you want doesn’t fit under any of their categories, then you can choose the HTML widget type). Since Netvibes allows you to place quality information aggregation widgets all on one page, it makes for a phenomenal start page. There is a great mobile friendly version available at http://iphone.netvibes.com/. Check out Netvibes @ http://www.netvibes.com/ ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Operating System"],

What will, are the following steps:   1. Get Cocos2D! This is if you hadn&#8217;t already downloaded it. Click here, and download the STABLE VERSION. The unstable version, is well, kind of like a bipolar divorcee. 2. Unarchive the file, or unzip it. Same thing. Double-click the file you just downloaded. A folder should appear. 3. Drag the folder to the desktop. It makes for easier use. 4. Open Terminal. If you aren’t familiar with Terminal, it is the Mac equivalent of the Windows’s Command Prompt. Just go to Finder, click Applications, and scroll till you find Terminal. Open it. 5. Type “cd” (make sure you leave out the quotations. Then hit the spacebar once after you typed the c and d) 6. Remember the folder from Steps 2 and 3? Well, you need to drag the entire folder from your desktop into Terminal. Make sure there is exactly one space between where you dropped the folder, and the letters c and d. 7. Press return. 8. Type the following: ./install-templates.sh -u 9. Press return. 10. If you did everything correctly, text should be appearing at an inhuman rate in the Terminal window. If not, it has to probably due with the text you have to type manually. Check everything once more. 11. Once the text stops, open Xcode. On the left side of the Xcode Menu Window, under templates, you’ll notice the new User Templates which you just added! 12. You are ready to roll now! If you have any problems, contact us and we’ll fix the tutorial. ","categories": ["Cocos2D"],

        "title": "HTML Tutorial I &#8211; The Basics",
        "excerpt":"Regardless of what people tell you, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is not hard to learn. It is arguably the easiest of the 4 major Web Development languages (HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP) to learn. In the following tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a webpage that says “Hello World!” You can use any plain text editor to write the webpage. If you use a Mac, TextEdit works well. If you use a PC, Notepad works. If you want to try a very good HTML Text Editor, use Notepad++ or HTML Notepad. They both support many features (such as code highlighting) in Python, Perl, CSS, Javascript, and More! In order to compile your HTML page, simply go to File -&gt; Save As and save it as a .html file. If given the options choose UTF-8 encoding and save as ‘all files’. Saving procedures differ from program to program. Now that you’ve saved it, drag and drop that .html file onto your favorite web browser (assuming you have content on your page, it will appear). If you are using a non-HTML specific editor, ensure that Rich Text Formatting is turned off. When you create a simple HTML page, you can use the following template. In most HTML web pages, you need to include the following.             &lt;HTML&gt; &lt;!-- Required--&gt;            &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;!-- This shows the title of the page--&gt;            &lt;TITLE&gt;--Include Name Here--&lt;/TITLE&gt; &lt;!-- This is the Title of your page--&gt;            &lt;/HEAD&gt;            &lt;BODY&gt;            --You include all the Webpage content here--            &lt;/BODY&gt;            &lt;/HTML&gt;        The first thing you should know about HTML, is that it uses things called “Tags.” The Tags in the template are &lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;HEAD&gt;, &lt;HTML&gt;…You get what they are. They are pieces of code included in the &lt;&gt;. When you start a tag, you write the tag above what you’re including in your tag. After you finish what you wanted to include in your tag, you end it with a tag that looks like this &lt;/BODY&gt;. It doesn’t have to say BODY. It is supposed to say whatever the Tag you specified says. For Hello World!, you use the template above. But where it says &lt;BODY&gt;, you hit return once. Then type “Hello World!” The code should look like this. What you should type is italicized.             &lt;HTML&gt;            &lt;HEAD&gt;            &lt;TITLE&gt;My Hello World! Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;            &lt;/HEAD&gt;            &lt;BODY&gt;            Hello World!            &lt;/BODY&gt;            &lt;/HTML&gt;      In order to test out your program, save your program as an html file by typing in .html after the document’s name. Then drag and drop the .html file into your browser and watch the magic! And now you have mastered the basics: Remember the following       HTML uses Tags. i.e. &lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;/BODY&gt;         You have to include the ending tag. You know it is the ending tag because it contains the same letters as the previous tag, as well as a forward slash before the word.         You can incorporate Javascript if you are feeling adventurous.         And finally, you can use basic Text Editing software. Word won’t work, but even more basic ones that are pre-installed on the computer will. Try Notepad and Text Edit (for PC and Mac, respectively). Also, try out HTML Notepad. It works beautifully, and lets you incorporate Javascript, Perl…   Enjoy! ","categories": ["HTML","Tutorials"],

        "title": "iWork Now Available On iPhone And iPod Touch",
        "excerpt":"   iWork, Apple’s office application suite, has finally made it’s way to the app store for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The popular iWork application bundle for Macintosh consists of Pages (similar to Microsoft’s Word, it allows you to create documents), Numbers (similar to Microsoft’s Excel, it allows you to create charts, tables, and other data displaying illustrations), and Keynote (similar to Microsoft’s Powerpoint, it allows you to create slide presentations), and costs $79 (USD). In 2010, Apple released a port of the office application suite on the iPad app store. Apple has been holding off on releasing the iWork applications to the iPhone and iPod Touch app store for quite some time now, so it comes as a surprise that they release it now. The iOS apps for the  iPhone and iPod Touch are selling for $9.99 a piece, so that’s $29.97 for the whole collection of iWork apps (not bad considering the original was $79). You might think that it would be absurd to try to create such complicated documents and presentations on these smaller devices, but I have found that its functionality and ease of use is really quite impressive. If you are interested in utilizing some top notch office apps on your iPhone or iPod Touch, I encourage your to check them out and consider buying them.

        "title": "ShiVa 3D &#8211; An Excellent Game Engine for Mobile Developers",
        "excerpt":"ShiVa 3-D is a very clean Game Engine/SDK that allows you to use a very simple programming language to make high-level graphics games for iPhone, Android and HTC devices. This language is not what you’d expect. Not JAVA, Python, or even Boo. It uses C++! Recently they ported their API’s to C++ so now, you can code using that language.           Beautiful Huh?   Anyways, ShiVa, similar to Unity 3D, let’s you develop games straight for the mobile device. It also allows you to develop games for Macs, PCs, and believe it or not, Wii Console, giving ShiVa versatility amongst developers.           Kind of What the Interface Looks Like   Some cool features of ShiVa include the ability to run a ShiVa server, with your game. This makes for MMO and VOIP applications to run with ease, and gives developers one less thing to worry about. In comparison to Unity 3D, I consider ShiVa to be better development software, as it has more platforms to work with, uses C++ as its main coding language, an editor that lets you edit from terrain to script AI’s, and a personal server that lets you host MMO games and VOIP. The only con of ShiVa in comparison to Unity 3D is the fact it costs more than Unity3D. Pricing:   ShiVa Server – €169.00 – €1499.00  ShiVa Training – €350.00 – €10000.00  ShiVa Editor – €0.00 (Educational, Editor PLE), €169.00 (Editor Basic), €1499.00 (Advanced)Some Handheld Games to Check out That Were Made through ShiVa: Voodoo Dice, Crusade of Destiny, Bellum: Tactics, Crosak, Graviton, and CastleGuard           VooDoo Dice's Gameplay   Some Computer Games made through ShiVa: Tiny Planet Explorer, Brukkon, Linus and Boom, and SBDC Check Out the Full Showcase Here ","categories": ["App Development","Software"],

        "title": "HTML Editors Review &#8211; A Review of Five Prolific Web Dev Editors",
        "excerpt":"There are many HTML editors out there. Picking one may be a difficult task, and is usually not intended for a reviewer to specify. That is why I took 5 Web Editors and reviewed them, due to the fact one may use one for different reasons. I also advise you developers (budding to experienced) to take a good review over the editors yourself, and make the final decision yourself. It is good for you to be comfortable with the software you are using.   1. Aptana Studio Platform: Mac Cost: Free Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as the ability to incorporate PHP, Rails, Ruby, and Python into the code Aptana Studio is one of the best HTML editors out there. It is free, and it is a beefy program that allows one to code in a plethora of Web Development languages. Not only does it have this kind of awesomeness, it has many different assistant widgets within the application that give this an apotheosis of possibilities. Some of the widgets include Code Assist, Deployment Wizard (used for Ruby applications), Built-in Terminal, and the ability to customize your own IDE! This means you can do everything you wanted web development wise, and still customize to be ergonomic to your needs! Wow! Click Here For Aptana Studio           This is the Code Assistant               As you can see, this guy likes CSS      2. HTML Notepad Platform: PC Cost: Free Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, and XML This is the best HTML editor for beginners. It is somewhat more advanced than Notepad, but easy enough to learn that one could be familiar with the interface just by looking at it. It doesn’t have any of the fancy features like Aptana has, but it is nice and clean. It is also free, which makes it even better for beginners. I advise you to try this out. Click Here for HTML Notepad           Screenshot of the Nice Colors it Produces     3. Komodo IDE Platform: PC, Linux, Mac Cost: $295 with an upgrade price of $95 Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, and XML This IDE is for those of you who are pros and want to do everything in one. Komodo IDE has many, many features, and very important ones too. These include free templates, color coding, no limits (during the trial), code assistance, and tag completion. On top of those cool features, there is no subscription to Komodo, and once you buy it, it is yours. This is some pretty awesome stuff.           Awesome Layout      Click Here for Komodo IDE 4. Eclipse Platform: PC, Linux, Mac, Unix Cost: Free Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, ASP, XML A highly sophisticated and professional software, Eclipse is probably for those of you who want a step-up from HTML Notepad. You might’ve seen Eclipse as a C++ IDE (which is quite good, but not as good as other IDE’s). Eclipse isn’t much different from the HTML Notepad, besides the fact it has more abilities and can be used on a Mac.           Eclipse Interface   Click Here for Eclipse’s Website 5. SeaMonkey Platform: PC, Linux, Mac, Unix Cost: Free Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Perl, PHP, Python, ASP, XML, WYSIWYG SeaMonkey is one of the cooler and more interesting HTML Editors out there, as it puts a lot of emphasis on WYSIWYG. For those of you who are unfamiliar with WYSIWYG, it stands for “What You See Is What You Get.” Basically, it describes the editing of a program that looks very similar to its product. You can infer that these types of programs are quite easy to make. An interesting feature of SeaMonkey is that it is actually a Web Browser, Chat Client, and Web Editor all-in-one. It also has FTP embedded into the WYSIWYG editor allowing one to publish your sites immediately.           Adds to the Mysteriously Awesomeness That the Program Exudes   Click Here for SeaMonkey   So you have seen short snippets of each of the HTML Editors. My personal favorite is Aptana Studio (for Mac) and HTML Notepad (for Windows). The HTML Notepad is simple and efficient, and Aptana Studio is just amazing. I encourage y’all to try out the HTML Editors and determine yourself which one you like the best. And if these articles inspired you to begin HTML programming, you can always check some out here.

        "title": "Corona SDK &#8211; One of the Most User Friendly SDKs",
        "excerpt":"If you have played Bubble Ball, the game that took Angry Birds Free Version off of its velvet throne atop the Top Free iPhone Games, you would be familiar with its interface, as well as the fact a 14-year old boy created it. Though he only coded it while his mother did the marketing, level design, and artwork, it is still fantastic this boy did the programming. But this programming is quite easy to learn. This is part of the reason Corona SDK is such a great software. It is so great its apps have been downloaded 16,000,000 times! No jokes! Aside from the downloads, there are tons of cool things you can do with Corona. Here are some things to consider. 1. Physics Corona SDK has, hands down, the best commercial physics engine one could use for app development. The code is incredibly simple, and you can do so much. Watch these videos on the Ansca Mobile website to see how great the coding is. Seriously, Ansca Mobile created such a great physics engine.           A Game Called \"Siege Towers For Two\" by Outer Court   2. Simple Coding The code is incredibly simple to manipulate. If you watched the videos like a told you, (in fact, I commanded you), you’d be at least 1.3% impressed with the small amounts of code required to make stuff happen. There is a template for you to begin programming on the website that looks just like Fruit Ninja. It uses only 400 lines of code!!! Awesome! Here is a sample picture of this code.           Screen Shot of the Code. I'm afraid I can't show you the finished product, but just take a look over it.   3. Templates On the website, there are tons of different templates you can use. There is a Fruit Ninja-esque template, Air Hockey, Simple Pool, and a game called Ghosts vs. Monsters (really cool, similar to Angry Birds). These are very helpful and beneficial to budding Corona Developers, and I do recommend trying them out, if you choose to use Corona SDK.           Ghosts vs. Monsters     And there you have it! Some of the great reasons to use Corona SDK. Check out the website, and look at the great games they have published. Enjoy some of the screenshots of games created using Corona!

        "title": "The Complete Scoop On The Apple Keynote Announcements At The 2011 WWDC",
        "excerpt":"On June 6th of 2011, Apple gave a keynote presentation at the WWDC (Worldwide Developer Conference). If you missed it, you can view the 2 hour presentation on Apple’s website right here. As to be expected, Apple announced some awesome new products and software upgrades. Namely iOS 5, Macintosh OS 10.7 (dubbed “Lion”), and iCloud. iOS 5           iOS 5 features a revamped notification system!   iOS, Apple’s mobile operating system that runs on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, received a major update in the form of iOS 5. iOS 5 consists of 200 new features for users, and 1,500 new APIs for developers. In the keynote, the top 10 features were explained in detail. They are as follows:   A revamped Notifications System: You can view a list of your notifications at anytime by swiping downward from the top of the screen. Plus, you can view stocks and weather reports right from your notifications screen. Another great modification has to deal with the way notification alerts are displayed. Unlike in previous versions of iOS, the new notifications don’t interrupt your activities on your iOS device. Instead, a neat little bar peaks out from the top of the screen alerting you, and, if you choose to ignore it, it slides back out of view. Lastly, as shown in the picture above, your notifications are displayed on the lock screen in an elegant list. If you want to go to the app that a notification corresponds to, you can simply select the notification and “Slide to reply”.  Newsstand: You can subscribe to your favorite magazines and newspapers in a single app that comes pre-installed on your homescreen. Issues are automatically updated in the background and offline reading is supported. Another cool feature is that the covers themselves automatically update.  Twitter Integration: Single sign-on is now supported. You can enter your username and password in the settings app, and then apps downloaded from the app store can ask you if you would like to log in using your Twitter credentials. Twitter has also been integrated in the Photo, Safari, Youtube, and Camera apps in the form of convenient share buttons. In the contacts app, you have the option of finding pictures for your contacts by running a search on Twitter.  Mobile Safari Update: “Reader” allows you to tap a button in the Mobile Safari toolbar and the article will become “front and center” (it only shows the content). Also, when you email an article, all of the article content is sent. “Reading List” lets you save pages on the web to a list of pages that is synced between all of your Apple devices. The last feature worth mentioning is tabbed browsing on the iPad.  Reminders: A reminders app comes pre-installed onto the homescreen. This app allows you to store lists of things with the option to set a date and location. The app will remind you on the set date of the list, and, if a location is set, it will remind you of a list when you are leaving a certain location. The Reminders app is capable of syncing with iCal and Outlook.  Camera Update: Apple has finally realized that people use the camera app very frequently and want a quick way to access it. Now, a camera button can be found on the lock screen of iOS devices that allows you to snap a photo without even typing in a passcode. Not to worry, you can’t access anything else or even see the photo library without entering the passcode. Ironically Apple decided to include a feature that they have banned developers from incorporating in the past. This feature is pressing the audio buttons on the iDevice in order to capture a photo.  Mail Update: Simply put, there are more features for text formatting such as making text bold, making text italicized, making text underlined, and indenting lines. In addition, you can easily search the contents of a message and flag messages.  PC Free: You no longer need to connect the iOS device to a computer loaded with iTunes in order to use the device. As a bonus, all software updates can be done over a wireless internet connection. As if THAT weren’t great enough, all of the software updates are to be delta updates! (they only add the part that’s being updated as opposed to re-installing the whole system.  Game Center Update: Profile pictures, comparing yourself to other users through achievement points, seeing friends of friends, friend discovery, and game recommendations are all included in the update to Game Center. For developers, turn-based games can be built into your apps by means of some new APIs.  iMessage: A new messaging app will be included with all installs of iOS 5 that makes an iOS-wide messaging service available to users. Some neat features include picture messaging, video messaging, contact sharing, and group messaging. On top of that, you can choose to be notified when a message is delivered successfully and when a message is read by the recipient. Mimicking Google Chat, you can also tell when the other person is typing. Following the device-syncing theme in iOS 5, all of your messages will be synced across your iOS devices. This is one of the features that I am concerned about as it duplicates the functionality available on many popular messaging apps and, as a consequence, the usage of such apps is headed for a major decline. I wouldn’t want to be a messaging app developer right now.Some other features include a keyboard that splits into two sections to support typing with hands on either side of the iPad, creating and deleting calendars, simple photo editing, creating and removing mailboxes, Wi-Fi sync to iTunes, and mirroring the iPad screen onto an Apple TV. The update will be released the the general public this Fall. Macintosh OS 10.7 “Lion”            Mission Control     Macintosh, the operating system used by over 54 million people around the world that runs on all of Apple&#8217;s personal computers, has finally received the next major update. Many features were highlighted such as&#8230;   Multi-Touch Gestures: Many applications and user interface elements in Lion make heavy use of finger gestures tracked by the trackpads on Apple’s latest notebook computers or by a separate touch-sensitive trackpad accessory. On such user element that has a major multi-touch gesture makeover is scrolling. No longer will you see scroll bars on Lion. Instead, you can use a finger scrolling gesture to move through the contents of a list or page within an application.  Full Screen Apps: There is now a simple, standard method for developers to make their applications compatible with a full-screen interface. In addition, the user interface for windows has been updated with a button in the top right corner for making an application full-screen or windowed. This is cool enough in itself, but now you can also use multi-touch gestures to switch between application screens, your desktop, and your dashboard.  Mission Control: With a simple gesture, you can now get an overlook at all of your open windows and applications. This is basically a combination of Spaces and Expose with some more eye candy and minor features. Plus, there is now a space for your dashboard.  Mac App Store Updates: Developers can take advantage of in-app purchases, push notifications, and sandboxing. Users will be able to enjoy speedy delta updates.  Launchpad: Launchpad ports over a major user interface feature from iOS. Namely, with a simple multi-touch gesture you can view all of the applications on your computer (simliar to the pages and pages of applications in iOS). These applications can be spread across multiple pages, and can be organized into folders.  Resume: When you open an application, Lion remembers where you were before you last quit it and it displays the corresponding windows, open files, settings, etc.  Auto Save: Lion automatically save all of your work as you edit it. Plus, the menu of document now has a list of options relating to this auto saving feature. You can view all of the saved versions of document, lock the document to prevent further writing, duplicate the document, and revert to the last opened version of the document.  Versions: Versions utilizes the auto saving feature in Lion. New versions of your documents are automatically saved as you edit them, you can take manual version saves, the saves are efficiently stored (with only the changes between versions actually being saved), and only the current version of a document being shared when a document is shared with other people. As mentioned in the description about auto saving, there is an option in the document title menu that allows you to view all versions of a document in a Time Machine type interface.  AirDrop: AirDrop is a Peer-to-Peer file sharing network that runs over a Wi-Fi network. In finder, there is an option for AirDrop. In this section, you can see all of the other Lion computers on the network and sharing files with other users is as easy as drag n’ drop. For added security, users need to confirm actions when sending and receiving files (though really you shouldn’t even use a Wi-Fi network where there might be users with malicious intent). All files are fully encrypted as they are sent.  Mail Update: The mail application that comes with all Macintosh computers has been updated with iOS-like user interface. This interface includes a left-hand side email list and a conversation view.In addition, there is a favorites bar where you can keep folder buttons. Lastly, the search bar now sports suggestions.Lion will be available for purchase through the Mac App Store for $29.00 (includes unlimited licenses for personally owned Macs). Because there is, sadly, no CD, rebooting the computer to experience the new version of the OS is unnecessary. Lion is most likely to be released some time in July. iCloud           iCloud keeps your files synced between your iDevices     Apple has decided to release a product that will sync all of your files across all of your devices via the cloud for a flat rate of FREE. With the release of iCloud comes the termination of the Mobile Me service that has been provided by Apple for quite a while. To summarize the functionality of iCloud, once you modify media, contacts, calendars, etc. on your iOS and Macintosh devices, the change (whether it be new pictures, added contacts, deleted calendar events) will be mirrored on all of your other devices. Calendars have unique functionality in that you can share calendars with other iCloud users. As for mail, you get an @me.com email account, new messages are pushed to all of your devices, and your inbox is kept in sync across all of your Apple devices (as they are with any other IMAP mail services). In the app store, you can view all of your app downloading history on all of your devices AND sync your applications across your devices. Same goes for iBooks. Lastly, all of the information and data on your device will be backed up to Apple servers so that you can restore all of it onto your device later, and so that it is easy to migrate to a new iOS device.   The other main functionality is online storage. You get 5GB of online storage for free, and content purchased from Apple services doesn&#8217;t count against that space.   Oh, and &#8220;one more thing&#8221;. Say you want to upload music that you purchased&#8230;er&#8230; gained possession of somewhere other that iTunes. There is an Apple service that you can pay for ($24.95 a year) called &#8220;iTunes Match&#8221; that will look at the tracks on your device and match them to songs on Apple&#8217;s database. You will be able to listen to these songs on all of your devices as long as you continue to pay the fee for this service. ","categories": ["Hot News","iOS"],

        "excerpt":"All these years, I’ve been unaware of a great system preference in the Macintosh OS that allows you to set your mouse to have up to three buttons (left, right, center) and/or set other buttons on the mouse to do a preferred task. What amazed me the most about this is that I could turn a mouse with what I thought had only one button to a mouse with a normal left and right click.                     The mouse setting in system preferences               No longer must I suffer as I reach waaaaay across the keyboard to the &#8220;control&#8221; button and apply intense mental concentration as I try to press it at the same time that I click the left mouse button. In order to experience the same relief that I am enjoying, simply head on over to your local system preferences and click &#8220;Mouse&#8221;. That will bring you to the settings panel as displayed in the picture above. Set the right mouse button to &#8220;Secondary Button&#8221; and you now have a right click enabled mouse! Congratulations, and good luck getting used to it!           This settings panel is also great for making any other mouse button modifications that you want.

        "title": "HTML Tutorial II &#8211; Simple Tags for Your Usage",
        "excerpt":"HTML is one of the easiest languages to learn. Specification: Programming languages. But I’m pretty sure you understood what I meant. HTML is easy, because once you learn how to use tags, it is all a matter of incorporating tags in a nice, clean manner to make the website aesthetically brilliant. But HTML itself will not give you a nice, clean website. You need a balance of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP as well as XML, ASP and others (depends on your goal). A metaphor for these languages is like a car. HTML is the frame of the car, seats, hood, glass, CSS is the paint and luxury accessories, Javascript is the engine and wheels, while PHP, XML, ASP (and others) are hood ornaments and other items. Anyways, I digress. So if you learned the basics of HTML programming, all you’ll need to learn are the awesome tags. Here is a chart with the tags and what they do. It isn’t all the tags, just some basic ones. For this tutorial, look over the tags, and then scroll down.               Tag                  What it Does                  Example                  What Example Looks Like                        &lt;/td&gt;

Let us note first of all that we can&#8217;t stop Dr. Blabbah overnight. It takes time, patience and experience to grant people the freedom to pursue any endeavor they deem fitting to their skills, talent, and interest. Although he has tremendous popular appeal if I chose to do so I could write exclusively about Dr. Blabbah&#8217;s fickle, gormless antics and never be lacking for material. Nonetheless, I&#8217;d rather spend some time discussing how just because Dr. Blabbah and his forces don&#8217;t like being labelled as &#8220;piteous megalomaniacs&#8221; or &#8220;treacherous philosophasters&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean the shoe doesn&#8217;t fit. What kind of loser wants to diminish our will to live? A loser like Dr. Blabbah. I like to say that his sophistries will come back to bite us in the behind faster than you can say &#8220;counterintelligence&#8221;. Dr. Blabbah never directly acknowledges such truisms but instead tries to turn them around to make it sound like I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s okay if his utterances initially cause our quality of life to degrade because &#8220;sometime&#8221;, &#8220;someone&#8221; will do &#8220;something&#8221; &#8220;somehow&#8221; to counteract that trend. I guess that version better fits his style—or should I say, &#8220;agenda&#8221;? While this letter hasn&#8217;t provided anything in the way of a concrete plan of action, it may help us focus our thinking a little better when we do work out a plan. For now, we must listen to others. I will doubtlessly be happy to have your help in this endeavor.

Although he has tremendous popular appeal if I chose to do so I could write exclusively about Dr. Blabbah&#8217;s fickle, gormless antics and never be lacking for material. Nonetheless, I&#8217;d rather spend some time discussing how just because Dr. Blabbah and his forces don&#8217;t like being labelled as &#8220;piteous megalomaniacs&#8221; or &#8220;treacherous philosophasters&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean the shoe doesn&#8217;t fit. What kind of loser wants to diminish our will to live? A loser like Dr. Blabbah. I like to say that his sophistries will come back to bite us in the behind faster than you can say &#8220;counterintelligence&#8221;. Dr. Blabbah never directly acknowledges such truisms but instead tries to turn them around to make it sound like I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s okay if his utterances initially cause our quality of life to degrade because &#8220;sometime&#8221;, &#8220;someone&#8221; will do &#8220;something&#8221; &#8220;somehow&#8221; to counteract that trend. I guess that version better fits his style—or should I say, &#8220;agenda&#8221;? While this letter hasn&#8217;t provided anything in the way of a concrete plan of action, it may help us focus our thinking a little better when we do work out a plan. For now, we must listen to others. I will doubtlessly be happy to have your help in this endeavor.

        "title": "Use Email To Send Text Messages To Cell Phones For Free",
        "excerpt":"   Many cell phone service providers have a useful feature set up that allows you to send a short, text-only email to a cell phone. However, you have to know a person’s cell phone service provider cell phone number in order to make use of this service. Free in most cases, this e-mail to SMS gateway can be utilized by sending an email to the-person’s-cell-number@provider-specific-domain-name.com. For example, say I know a person who’s cell phone service is provided by AT&amp;T and his cell number is 1234567890. I could send them a text message by sending an email to 1234567890@txt.att.net. Note that the cell phone number must include the area code. This little-known service is quite useful if you don’t have your cell-phone with you and you want/need to text someone, if you like to send reminders to yourself, if you find it more comfortable to text with a keyboard, or if you can’t afford a texting service plan. Here’s a comprehensive list of providers and their corresponding domain names:             Service Provider                  Address To Send To (10-digit-phone-number@provider.com)                    AT&amp;T                  @txt.att.net                    Verizon Wireless                  @vtext.com                    T-Mobile                  @tmomail.net                    Sprint                  @messaging.sprintpcs.com                    Virgin Mobile                  @vmobl.com                    Alltel                   @message.alltel.com                    Boost Mobile                  @myboostmobile.com                    U.S. Cellular                  @email.uscc.net         If, for some crazy reason, the provider that you want to send to isn’t on this list, then you will want to check out this massive list on Wikipedia.

However, even as we strive to beat out our friend’s graphics card, it is still nice to take a trip back to the humble beginnings of games. Although most end-users won’t like the thought of the graphics-free gaming experience of a fictional world, they may be, much like I was, surprised at how much fun they can have while playing one of these classic games.  Even though most people would look at the lack of pictures and maps as a loss, once they get deep into a game, one can find that having a picture of the world solely in your mind allows a person to closely scrutinize the environment that a console-based graphics-fueled game would never allow you to do.  If this post has made you curious to experience the classic gaming magic that is a text-based adventure, there are many ways to enjoy a game across a number of platforms.  Now, if you download an interpreter and are afraid that you may come across a shortage of games, fear not because there is an entire database of free (and paid) games.  This website is here, at the IFDB (Interactive Fiction Database).  Happy Typing!

        "excerpt":"  Those of us that spend great amounts of time in front of a computer monitor have likely been told about the 20-20-20 rule by our family, friends, and optometrists. The rule states that after staring at a computer monitor for 20 minutes, you should look at something at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. The goal of this exercise is to give your eyes a break. It helps prevent vision loss, dry eyes, eye redness, eye fatigue, and other forms of eye irritation.           ProtectYourVision.org's Break Reminder Screen   If you try to follow this rule, you will no doubt find that it is extremely difficult to remember to look away from your monitor and/or that it is annoying to keep track of 20 minute intervals. ProtectYourVision.org recognizes these difficulties and provides a convenient solution. The web service allows you to set a specified amount of time between breaks, after which it will sound a chime in order to remind you to look away from your glaring computer screen. If you hit the “let’s take a break” button that appears at your designated break time, ProtectYourVision will turn your entire screen black as it counts down from the selected break length time. As a bonus, it will show you some eye exercises that you can practice during your break. For your sake, I hope that you use this invaluable tool. It’s easy to set up, and your eyes will thank you!

        "excerpt":"                                                                                          Everyone has, at one point or another, had to change to a different Internet browser and we have all had to deal with re-entering passwords, bookmarks, and other personal add-ons.  Well, as some of you may or may not know, Google has come out with their own Internet browser called Google Chrome.  There are many features that should convince one to use this browser over others such as Safari, Internet Explorer, and Firefox.  To name off a few features that have put Chrome at the top of my list are:  the Omnibox, Sandboxing, Extensions, Experimental Features, Web App Store, and Google Sync.  However, one of the most amazing features that I have found in Google Chrome, Sync, is also the easiest to overlook.                                                                                                                                      Although most users will never play with settings in some applications, I pray that they will explore this feature.  To set up sync, you will need to, if running Macintosh, go to the &#8220;Chrome&#8221; menu tab and select &#8220;Set Up Sync&#8230;&#8221;. For Windows users, click the Tool icon and select &#8220;Set Up Sync&#8230;&#8221;. When a user activates Sync in their Chrome browser, it will ask them for their Google Account information.  Once this is entered, Chrome will automatically start syncing all the user’s saved information (extensions, add-ons, themes, saved passwords, bookmarks, etc.) to Google’s servers.  What this means is that if a user has configured their Chrome’s Sync feature and they bought a new computer, all they would have to do is download Chrome onto the new computer and activate Sync.  Soon after, all of their saved information will be automagically put into the new Chrome.  This feature takes out the headache of re-entering passwords, re-finding (and saving) bookmarks, re-finding themes, and instead makes browser migration easy across computers.  It has been a boon to me and I can personally attest to it working.  Knowing how people can be afraid to mess with settings, I thought that it may be fairly hidden and secluded.                                                                   Hopefully this has either convinced someone to convert to Chrome or, if you are already a Chrome user, to activate this feature!  I mean, why have an application and not utilize it to its full potential?  Now, a skeptical person may be wary about syncing all of their information to Google.  Never fear.  You can control what is synced using a handy little pop-up manager box in the browser.  This lets the user choose whether to sync only passwords, themes, autofill, etc., or to simply sync everything.

        "title": "New Google Search Features: Instant Pages, Search By Image, And Search By Voice",
        "excerpt":"Yesterday, Google announced (at the Inside Search event) two new features for Google search. Namely, you are no longer limited to searching by text (now search with voice and images), and 0 second page loads for websites on your search results. You can look forward to seeing these features as they are released over the next couple of days. Search By Voice  Google is finally incorporating the voice search functionality that has been available on their Android devices for years. That is,  you will now be able to click a little microphone button in the Google search bar and speak a word or phrase out loud (SAWOPOL). Google will make a valiant attempt at deciphering your warbling and will display the search results for the said word or phrase. It’s as simple as that. This feature will only be available to Chrome users. Search By Image  With Google’s new search by image feature, you can either drag n’ drop a photo from your desktop onto the Google Image search bar and google will find relevant information regarding the photo (location, artist, architect, photographer, application, etc.) as well as locations where the photo already resides on the web. Alternatively, you can perform a simple copy-and-paste of an image URL to achieve the same results. The dragging and dropping of an image file into the Google search bar can only be performed on Chrome or on Firefox (via a plug-in). One unobvious use that I have found myself utilizing is using this image search to find other sizes of an image that are available around the web. Instant Page Loading For Search Results  With the new instant loading feature, Chrome users will experience dumbfoundingly short loading times for websites navigated to in search results. These loading times are as short as possible: 0 seconds flat. You might ask how this is possible. Well, Chrome will automatically fetch the websites in search results before you even go to them. By the time you click on the link, your destination is already completely loaded.  ","categories": ["Hot News"],

        "title": "Pros and Cons of Chromebooks",
        "excerpt":"   All across the Internet, Google has been putting ads up for their new “Chromebooks”. These laptops (that are being made by Samsung and Acer) will run Google’s own Chrome OS. Chrome OS is merely the Chrome browser taken to extremes. The main thing about Chrome OS is that it operates almost one hundred percent on the web. In fact, the only thing about it that isn’t web-oriented are the files a user downloads onto the Chromebook’s small, solid state hard drive. Although this defies previously held notions about laptops, these Chromebooks represents a small step toward a paradigm shift from local computing to cloud computing. The thought of having nearly every aspect of an operating system in the cloud has both positive and negative aspects. I have had the pleasure of experiencing most of these aspects before most, because I was chosen to receive a beta Chromebook last December. The pros and cons that follow are from what I could take from my experiences. Pros: -Easy recovery Seeing as how everything is in the cloud, recovering your settings, bookmarks, etc., is really easy. Just a simple download. -Security There being nothing on the actual laptop except a Linux kernel to run processes, a virus or other malware would find nothing to infect. -Speed Because it has a low CPU load, my Chromebook boasted a very, very fast boot time. -3G Connectivity My Cr-48 Chromebook (and, I think, the Chromebooks being manufactured) come fully equipped to access the web via Verizon Wireless’ 3G cell signal. -Built-in Webcam and Mic This is good for a number of reasons. -Log-In To sign in to a Chromebook, one just has to sign in to their Gmail account. -Easy Set-up Pain free set-up. Cons: -Wifi Required To use a Chromebook, one MUST be connected to a source of wifi. -Flash Player The version of Flash that the netbooks have doesn’t recognize the webcam, so some websites do not work correctly. -File Compatibility The operating system does not recognize all of the file extensions that a normal computer would. Ex: m4v, mov, wmv, etc. -Buggy The entire Chrome OS is still a beta, so there will be a few bugs to deal with. -Chrome Supported Some websites do not have a “Chrome Friendly” version of their site, which makes the page render in ways that it should not. All-in-all, if you are a computer power-user then a Chromebook would never fully replace your standard work machine, but it will offer an interesting change of pace. However, if everything you do is on the web then a Chromebook could possibly be right a cheaper and faster solution to your computing needs. In the end you, as the consumer, must choose. Chromebooks are commercially available as of June 15th. ","categories": ["Google","Operating System","Review"],

        "title": "Store Your Music In The Cloud And Enjoy Your Collection Anywhere With Google Music (Review)",
        "excerpt":"   As I type this, I am listening to some of my favorite songs through the web interface of Google Music Beta. After applying to become a beta tester over a month ago, Google finally sent me an email inviting me to their music service. I immediately started uploading my music collection through the Music Manager application that Google provides. On a Mac, the user interface is actually accessed via a panel in the system preference application. I was given the optons to upload music from my iTunes library, my music folder, or another folder. After my songs were quietly uploaded in the background, I was able to access my song library on any computer by logging in on http://music.google.com. As a bonus, Google Music is compatible with iOS and can be accessed, with all features available, through any web browser on iOS. Song information such as name, length, album, number of plays, and rating is displayed with all of your songs. The web interface of Google Music consists of a sidebar, player controls, a main area to display song information, and a search bar. Overall, I believe that the interface is somewhat like that of a trimmed down iTunes. According to Google’s help articles, the limit to the number of songs that you can upload is 20,000. That’s a lot! In fact, I’m sure that that is far more than I’ll ever need. An interesting thing to note is that song length/size isn’t measured. This means that you can upload lossless audio files many hours in length (think audiobooks and concerts). Assuming you are uploading the mp3 files of songs of average length to Google Music, you could easily end up consuming around 120 GB of storage on Google’s servers! All in all, I believe that Google Music is a very promising service. It has many points that compete with other online music storage services like Apple’s iCloud and Amazon’s Cloud Drive &amp; Player such as a very high song limit and easy access on all of your devices. You can request access to Google Music at http://music.google.com (if you are reading this post far in the future, then Google Music will likely be out of beta and you won’t need to request access anymore).

        "title": "Top 10 iPhone Games &#8211; Point-and-Click iPhone Games",
        "excerpt":"Point-and-Click games aren’t for the impatient (unless you use a walkthrough which is cheating but makes the game more enjoyable. I am pretty impatient and use the walkthroughs for these games). Which means they aren’t for everyone. But I encourage you to try some out, even if you have to look up a walkthrough. The stories of the games can be quite engaging and entertaining. Some of the them are just downright silly, while some have a very serious story to them. Here are my favorite Point-and-Click iPhone Games. You’ll notice most of them have been ported from other devices. 1. The Secret of Monkey Island Developer: LucasArts Price: $2.99 (iPhone), $4.99 (iPad) This classic game is what I meant by silly. It follows a wannabe pirate named Guybrush Threepwood who ventures to Melee Island to become a fierce pirate. As he becomes a pirate, his lady friend becomes kidnapped by the vicious LeChuck and taken to Monkey Island. This game has 4 sequels, which means it is either awesome or over inflated. I’d like to go with the first.           It is much cleaner than its original design   2. Myst Developer: Cyan Worlds Price: $4.99 This game is very elegant as well as frustrating (for me, as I have little patience). It has very clean graphics and was made some time ago. This ported version is one of the more serene games as you are a traveler in an unknown world trying to make sense of what happened to you. The storyline is humongous as you travel through multiple worlds taking note of your changing surroundings and notes left behind by the characters you don’t meet.           Quite Nice Graphics   3. Beneath a Steel Sky Developer: Revolution Price: $2.99 If you’ve noticed the trend, these games are all ports. Beneath a Steel Sky is a very interesting Point-and-Click game set in a dystopic future world. You take the role of a boy who lived in a tribal group on the outskirts of a large city who is taken by the military for unknown reasons. You try to make sense of the events that have happened as you also try to uncover a wicked plot that the dystopic government has been assembling. 4. HECTOR: Badge of Carnage Ep. 1 Developer: Straanlooper Price: $3.99 This game is not only perverse, it is crude and is rightfully recommended for over 17 years of age. In this first episode, you play as Hector, the city’s best negotiator as he tries to fulfill the demands of a “terrorist” who captured “hostages.” You’ll find yourself at times trying to convince a prostitute to give you her garter to convincing a criminal to take his pants off. Now that you are either disgusted or excited, you shouldn’t or should buy this game.           Least Explicit Picture of the Game I Could Find     5. Sam and Max Episode 1: The Penal Zone Developer: Telltale Inc. Price: $6.99 This game was ported from the PC and was one of the first games to be available for iPad. It contains 3-D graphics as well as a pretty awesome story. It follows 2 detectives, 1 a dog and the other a rabbit as they try stop an intergalactic invader named Skunk’ape. The graphics are great as well as the intrigue of the entire plot.           Amazing 3-D Graphics             Interesting   6. City of Secrets Developer: Aidem Media Price: $0.99 This game has it all for those of you who don’t want to fork over a lot of money to the developers. City of Secrets has great 3-D graphics, as well as an interesting storyline. You follow the heroes, Rex and Mr. Mole as they try to uncover a “sinister plot.” There is much problem solving involved as well as uncovering the mysteries required to beat the game. The game maybe hard to follow at times but luckily, the developers added a feature that allows you to search for items in the screen.           Very Nice Graphics             Eh?   7. Simon the Sorceror Developer: iPhSoft Price: $1.99 This game uses retro and old-school graphics, similar to the original Monkey Island series but lacks the modern update that LucasArts gave Monkey Island. This 90’s game deals with goblins and potions, magic and beards, as you play as Simon, a teenager who was somehow transported into a dimension where cloak and pointy hats are the hottest things for humans to wear. Simon has to use “logic and magical skills” to progress through the game.           Guess Which One Is Simon? (Rhetorical Question)   8. 1112 Episodes 01/02 Developer: Agharta Studio Price: $4.99 – $7.99 In this mystery game, you play as a citizen named Louis as he tries to uncover the “reasons behind his constant headaches and strange dreams.” This may seem weird, but the game is quite interesting as it takes place in present day Jalonsville (doesn’t exist), New Jersey. The graphics are enticing but the storyline could come across as weird. 9. Flight of the Amazon Queen Developer: iPhSoft Price: $1.99 Flight of the Amazon Queen contains aspects of Indiana Jones and The Secret of Monkey Island. It has the graphics and humor the LucasArts put such detail into but it has a storyline that one would expect to see with Indiana Jones. Sadly, Flight of the Amazon Queen hasn’t been as prolific as other Point and Click Games, but it is nonetheless a great one to check out.           Pun Intended             Ta-Da?     10. Broken Sword: Director’s Cut Developer: Revolution Price: $4.99 This game has been quite prolific in the Point-and-Click games section of the App Store and is for good reason. A murder goes off in a place called Palais Royale and you play as a lady named Nico who has been brought to Paris to interview a statesman named Pierre Carchon. As you venture through France, you become closer and closer to the crime and soon it becomes personal…Well, only for Nico. You just want to finish the game. Or not.           Interesting Graphics   **&lt;/p&gt;           France     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;   And that concludes this list!

        "title": "5 More Websites Where You Can Listen To Music For Free",
        "excerpt":"A while back we reviewed a great service called Grooveshark. While it offers amazing service, some of us crave more. More variety, more features, more songs, more interface. Some of us crave less. Fewer features, simple interface, few distractions. In this post, I aim to compile a list of five more websites where you can listen to music on demand, in unlimited quantity, and for free. I’m sure that at least one of these web services will be your cup of tea. MixTape    Mixtape scans the web for mp3 files and provides a clean interface for absorbing this media. With Mixtape, you can easily play playlists, create playlists, share playlists, and listen to your favorite songs. A great, unique feature of Mixtape is that it scours the web for relevant information regarding your song including an artist bio, lyrics, album covers, and music videos. Another  Tho only complaint I have about Mixtape is a side effect of looking for an alternative source for a song if the selected one is unavailable. This side effect is that a song with a similar name but by a different artist is sometimes played, which can be somewhat annoying. Head on over to http://mixtape.me/ to listen to some groovy tunes! Fizy With its simple black-and-white interface, Fizy makes it easy to find your favorite tunes and play them in a basic player. Like MixTape, Fizy aggregates music files from around the web and doesn’t host any files on its server. Some more advanced features include Last.fm scrobbling, Twitter auto-posting of songs you are listening to, FriendFeed auto-posting of songs you are listening to, and RSS feed generation with updates of your activity. There is also a share button for easy song sharing among a good chunk of social networks (with this comes the generation of links to certain songs in Fizy’s library). Occasionally, Fizy will find a music video that corresponds with the song that is playing and will let you play it by clicking a video button. Rock out to some great tracks at http://fizy.com/{#internal-source-marker_0.8321641157381237}. PlaylistNow    PlaylistNow boasts unique functionality through its main search bar. Instead of a normal search for a song or artist, PlaylistNow search helps you find playlists of songs that go along with the given activity. In addition to this, there is a normal search for songs. PlaylistNow pulls its music off of misc. video sharing sites. Play songs that go along with your favorite activity at http://playlistnow.fm/   SpoolSpool sports a simple interface with a player, a sidebar, and a search results section. The collection of songs in Spool’s realm is vast, with very complete search results for almost any given keyword. Spool is named “Spool” for a reason. In Spool, there is a feature called “Spools” which basically consists of a couple of webradio chatrooms. I think that it is a very cool concept that I’m sure will become popular when it is stolen by a more prominent web service. Get some tracks to dance to at http://spool.fm/ YouTube  That’s right. The most popular video sharing website of all time has a massive collection of user uploaded music videos that you can listen to and organize into playlists. I’m sure you know the URL, but here it is anyway: http://youtube.com ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Music"],

        "title": "Understanding Sorting Algorithms",
        "excerpt":"Question: What the !#$% is a Sorting Algorithm? Answer: Don’t !@$#-ing swear on Byte Revel. A Sorting Algorithm is a process of putting a group of objects in a certain list or order. Question: Why the heck would I need a Sorting Algorithm? Answer: Programs don’t just sort stuff when you tell them to. They need to have a method for sorting things and putting them in a certain order. If you have four numbers; 4,5,6, and 7; and you want to put them in order of largest odd number to smallest even number, you use a sorting algorithm. Now this seems pretty obvious; 7,5,6,4 is the answer. But how can you get a program to do this? You know the answer. There are several algorithms for programming usage. Some are just downright complicated. I’ll show you 3 algorithms that are simple to use so you get the gist of it.   Bubble Sorting AlgorithmThe Bubble Sorting Algorithm, or Bubble Sort, is one of the most simple ways to sort items. It compares 2 adjacent items together and swaps their position depending on the value of the item. The higher the value, it goes higher up. Here is an example of the Bubble Sort Algorithm: {7, 3, 1, 9, 5, 8} is a set of numbers that needs to be ordered {7, 3, 1, 9, 5, 8} Since 7 and 3 are the first two numbers in the set, they are swapped because {3, 7, 1, 9, 5, 8} {3, 7, 1, 9, 5, 8} Since 7 and 1 are the next two numbers in the set, they are swapped because 1&lt;7 {3, 1, 7, 9, 5, 8} {3, 1, 7, 9, 5, 8} Since 7 and 9 are the next two numbers in the set, they aren’t swapped because 7&lt;9 {3, 1, 7, 9, 5, 8} Since 9 and 5 are the next two numbers in the set, they are swapped because 9&gt;5 {3, 1, 7, 5, 9, 8} {3, 1, 7, 5, 9, 8} Since 9 and 8 are the next two numbers in the set, they are swapped because 9&gt;8 {3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 9} This isn’t finished because 7 is before 5 and 3 is before 1. So the process repeats itself: {3, 1, 7, 5, 8, 9} Since 3 and 1 are the next two numbers in the set, they are swapped because 3&gt;1 {1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 9} {1, 3, 7, 5, 8, 9} Since 7 and 5 are the next two numbers in the set, they are swapped because 7&gt;5 {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9} The rest is unnecessary but you have to program it. Look at this picture I got off of wikipedia to explain all of the stuff I just wrote.           Observe     Selection SortSelection Sort is a very simple algorithm. But very inefficient. What it does is it searches through the entire list of items, finds the smallest value, and swaps it with the first item. It the finds the second smallest value and swamps it with the second item. And that is all that happens. Look at the following picture (from Wikipedia) and see how it works.           It is Slower than Most Other Algorithms     Bogus SortThis is a very amusing sorting algorithm. It almost impossible to use. An example of using the Bogus Sort is checking a deck of cards or list of numbers. If they are in order from smallest to largest or however they are supposed to be, nothing happens. If they are not in order, and even if there are just 2 items misplaced, you throw the entire stack of numbers or deck of cards all over the place. That’s right. You throw them all over the place. You collect the cards or numbers, and see if they are in order. If they aren’t, you repeat the process. Eventually they will be in order, but after a maximum of (n-1)n! (if using a stack of numbers) or 52! if using the deck of cards. As you can see, Bogus Sort deserves its name. I hope you now have a better grasp of Sorting Algorithms. Enjoy!

        "title": "Play Classic Nintendo Games On Your Computer With The Nestopia Emulator",
        "excerpt":"          A Screenshot of Megaman on Nestopia   Nestopia is a highly functional Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator that enables you to play old-school Nintendo games such as Mario, Zelda, and Metroid on your computer. The program itself is an open-source project that (as is the nature of all open-source programs) is free to download and run. The initial release was developed by a man named Martin Freij, and it has since been ported to Linux and Macintoch by  R. Belmont and Richard Bannister. With a wide variety of features such as “savestate,” accurate video and audio emulation, and a built in cheat code menu for Game Genie, this is one of the most highly functional emulators out there.  It is also quite easy to install and use (simply download it from sourceforge and extract the files), and any classic Nintendo game you can think of is easily available online (just Google “Nestopia roms” for a wide selection of vintage games ready to be downloaded).  Assuming you have found a rom file and downloaded it, running it is as simple as either going to File -&gt; open, or double-clicking the rom file itself. It is important to keep in mind that the downloading of NES ROMs from the internet is illegal. The only way to use the emulator legally is to make the Rom yourself from your original copy. With that said, many people download Roms form the internet every day. In summary, download ROMs at your own discretion.

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 1 &#8211; Set Up Xcode, Output Hello World!, And Make Comments",
        "excerpt":"   Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language that builds upon the C programming language. The language is most commonly used on Apple’s Macintosh operating system and Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS. Before we start programming in Objective-C, we will want to set up our IDE. Xcode is the best IDE for Objective-C out there, so we’re going to go with that. In general, it’s best to always use the latest version of a piece of software. The latest version of Xcode (Xcode 4 as of the writing of this post) can be found in the Mac App Store ( link), and Apple charges USD $4.99 for it. If you aren’t able to shell out the cash, or if you are running a version of Mac OS younger than 10.6, you can sign up for a developer account at http://developer.apple.com/programs/register/ and then find an earlier version of Xcode at http://connect.apple.com (in the “Developer Tools” section). Once you have downloaded Xcode, open it (if you downloaded it to the default location, it can be found in the root folder -&gt; Developer -&gt; Applications -&gt; Xcode). Hit the “Create a new Xcode project” button. In the Mac OS X section of the sidebar, select “Application”. After that, choose “Command Line Tool” and, in the “Type” drop-down menu, choose “Foundation” (yes, Foundation as in the Foundation Series by Isaac Asimov =P ). Next, click the “Choose…” button and give your project a name. Save it, and your project window will open. The Hello World program is the default code of a new project. It can be found in the main file (projectname.m). The code is as follows:              #import             int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            NSLog(@\"Hello, World!\");            [pool drain];            return 0;            }      It would seem obvious that to run the program, you should click the “Build and Run” button. While this WILL run the program, you won’t actually be able to see any output! What you are going to want to do is go to (in the menu bar) Run -&gt; Console. This will bring up the console window that will show you program output and will allow for input as well. Hit “Build and Run” and watch “Hello World!” be outputted to the console! Now, let’s go through the program line by line and I will explain what you should know about this program. #import  This imports a header file that allows the computer to access the functionality of the Foundation framework. To simplify what I just said…. er… typed, there is a file with a bunch of code in it that you don’t want to have to type and this imports all of that code into the program. However, this functionality isn’t used in this program (and will run fine without it). int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) { This declares the main function, and is known as a “function header”. The main function is the starting point for all programs in Objective-C. It is what is run by the computer when the entire program itself is run. Functions in general are chunks of code that contain instructions for the computer. They can be called upon at any time from any other function. For now, don’t worry about the code in the parentheses. Lastly, the “{” (left curly brace) begins the body of the main function. NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]; This line borrows some memory from your computer so that your program can run. NSLog(@”Hello, World!”); NSLog is used to display/output text on the screen. Anything in the quotation marks is the text that gets outputted. [pool drain]; This line releases, or “drains”, the memory that we borrowed earlier in the NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]; line. return 0; This line returns the value “0” to the computer. Every function, except for the void function, returns a value. This value is described by the data type declared in the function header. In this case, the data type is an int, or integer. Returning the value of “0” indicates that the program ran successfully. } The right curly brace is simply the end of the body function.   Comments A comment is a section of text that isn’t run in a program. A single line comment is indicated by two forward slashes (//). All text after that on the same line won’t be run by the computer when it comes to it. Comments can be used to describe parts of your program, or to turn parts of your program off. In addition to a single line comment, there are multi-line comments. Multi-line comments are comments that cover more than when line. They are started with a “/” and ended with a “/”. Here’s an example of comments in use:              #import             int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            // this is a single line commment!            /*            this is a            multi-line            comment!            */            [pool drain];            return 0;            }      That’s all for now folks, I hope that you found this tutorial helpful! I encourage you to play around with the code by changing the text outputted with NSLog and by testing out comments.

        "title": "C++ Tutorial II &#8211; Float vs. Int",
        "excerpt":"You may be wondering what is a Float and why it has certain uses that Int cannot handle. All will be explained concisely so you can go back to whatever you do when you’re not at ByteRevel. What is a Float? A float stands for Floating Point. It is just a random point in space that has a certain value. Its main use is to define non-integral numbers. So it can be used with fractions. What is an Int? Int is the variable used to show numbers or letters that are integers. Since letters and words are not numeric, ints can handle them. But using Int cannot show fractions and decimals because they are not INTEGERS!!!! Float vs. Int Why not we just use floats? They can handle what ints can’t and what ints can. Well, using a float takes up more memory in a program. A normal float uses 4 bytes of memory in a computer while the extended form of a float, called a Double Float, takes up 8 bytes. Ints on the other hand use a range of 2 bytes to 4 bytes (on average) from a CPU. Which to Use? It all depends on your situation. If you are a budding programmer who wants to learn a new language, or you are interested in just learning C++ for the fun of it, its use is only defined by the size of the number (and if it is integral or not) you are using. The arithmetic behind using a Float or Int can get quite complicated and may require more than a website tutorial to understand. :) ","categories": ["C++","Tutorials"],

        "excerpt":"To understand it better, you should first be familiar with everyday C++ Math Functions. In the following tutorial, look over the following 5 examples and look at how the code changes. We’ll look at Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

All you really need to know is how to place a variable within the quotations. But that isn&#8217;t too hard is it?                                                           SUBTRACTION                                                           Our next function is subtraction and it is not any more difficult. If you must see what the code looks like, look below. Notice that you show the variables the same way you do with addition but you take out the addition sign and place a subtraction sign.                                                                                                 #include using namespace std;&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;                                                               int main()                                                                                   {                                                                                   int x;                                                                                   int y;                                                                                   cout&lt;&lt;&#8220;Have You Ever Wanted to subtract 2 Numbers?

In fact, multiplication and division are practically the EXACT SAME. Just change the sign. Look below for an example of each.

Look at it carefully and notice the following two points as you scan the code:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             At the beginning of the entire program, everything look standard, right?  iPodnerd defined all of the variables and all that happiness. But he used floats instead of integers! What the !@#$ is a float, you ask. Well, a float is another way of looking at integers. If you have trouble understanding floats, refer to this tutorial.                                                                                                                                                  The rest of the code is just like the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division segments, but all in one. He reuses the same variable to make the code more concise and easier to follow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That wasn&#8217;t so hard was it? Of course not! Next time, we&#8217;ll show you other C++ Math functions. And remember the following:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Addition uses &#8220;+&#8221; when adding numbers                                                                                                                                                  Subtraction uses &#8220;-&#8221; when subtracting numbers                                                                                                                                                  Multiplication uses &#8220;*&#8221; when multiplying numbers                                                                                                                                                  Division uses &#8220;/&#8221; when dividing numbers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Happy trails!

        "title": "ICANN To Open Up Custom Domain Suffixes For Registration",
        "excerpt":"   On Monday, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (often referred to as ‘ICANN’ for obvious reasons) announced that organizations will, starting in the near future, be able to purchase and register domains with custom suffixes. For those of you who aren’t studied up on the art of the domain, a domain suffix is the part of a domain after the dot. For example, the suffix of ByteRevel.com is “.com”. Prior to this announcement, there were about 22 generic top-level domain suffixes plus 250 country-level domain suffixes available for people to purchase a domain under. These domain suffixes ranged from 2 characters to 6 characters. With the new custom suffixe, they can be anywhere from 1 to 60 characters. In order to purchase a custom domain suffix, one must shell out $185,000 up front and then $25,000 every year thereafter. In addition, ICANN hopes to prevent cybersquatting by requiring applicants to have a highly legitimate reason as to why they should own the suffix. To put this into perspective, current .com domains typically go for around $10 a year (with no up front cost) and anyone can register a domain for any reason. Clearly, these custom domain suffixes won’t really be available to the average internet publisher. Many major businesses are sure to jump at the chance to buy up all domain suffixes that relate to their brand. For some, there is sure to be little argument or confusion. For example, Starbucks might want the domain suffix “.starbucks”. Other companies, such as Apple or Microsoft, are no doubt headed for an all-out war for suffixes such as “.computer”. What are your thoughts on ICANN’s announcement on custom domain suffixes? Comment! ","categories": ["Hot News"],

You may be asking yourself, “What on earth could these songs be about?” Most rappers rap about sex, drugs, and violence but that isn’t true for these nerd artists. They rap about what they know best: computers, hacking, technology, sci-fi, and old school literature. Thats right, a whole little rap genre completely devoted to being geeky. The best part about it all? Some of these albums are free! On top of that, one of Nerdcore’s biggest names, MC Lars, has publicly said that he doesn’t mind people pirating his music. Most of the nerd rap scene can be found on torrent sites if you look hard enough. These nerdcore rappers are mostly self produced, and independently published. All-in-all nerdcore is a huge up and coming music scene that drops 8-bit beats, and will launch a trojan into your occipital lobes. A few popular rappers in this genre are MC Lars, MC Frontalot, MC Chris, YTCracker, Dual Core, int80, and Beefy. All of these guys are also on twitter, so follow them for updates.

        "excerpt":"  This week Valve is making noise with Team Fortress 2, its popular online shooter game, that was released in 2007. How can such an old game make such news around the internet, you might ask.  Easy:  Valve released the game Free-To-Play.  That&#8217;s right, one of the greatest hat wearing and battle simulators that you can find on the web is now FREE.  To obtain your free copy just go here, and download the Steam client for your operating system (Mac and Windows supported), make an account.  Once you have the Steam client running it should be available to download.    Now for some background information on Valve.  Valve is an independent game development company that has produced a bunch of amazing games such as Portal, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Half-Life.  Valve has also developed a great distribution platform to get their games, along with other developers games, straight to the user’s PC or Mac.  This platform is Steam.  Steam allows people who play similar games to become friends, chat, and join groups to stay in touch.  It also allows people to browse the web, and stay in touch while playing games!  Valve revolutionized PC gaming with the release of their Steam store, and then once again when they released Steam for Mac, and now they are about to pull in tons of users with the Free-To-Play release of Team Fortress 2.

        "excerpt":" If you have ever messed around with any kind of downloadable media then you have experienced just how many different types and different formats there are. And no matter which operating system you have, whether you use Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows, you have probably run into some problems trying to open a certain media format. Each operating system has its own shortcomings. All can open mp3 files, but Windows doesn’t have spectacular support for mov or m4v files which OS X natively uses, and OS X doesn’t support wmv files. There are many ways to overcome these boundaries. On Windows you can always install QuickTime from Apple to run some files, and on OS X you can install Perian which adds a lot of codecs to QuickTime X. But many users do not want to install a bunch of extra things, either this or they do not know how to install extra things like this. So here comes the imminent question: How can I play any media format easily? As it turns out, the answer is three letters: VLC. VLC is a free, open source program that has the ability to provide near-flawless playback of nearly every single media format. Be it video, pictures, or some ungodly combination of both, VLC has a codec for it. It is a great fallback for anyone who downloads a lot of videos off of the Internet. VLC comes in every flavor imaginable, meaning that it can be downloaded for Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. To download this amazing application for your choice of operating system head here!

        "title": "Make Your Lists Social With List.ly!",
        "excerpt":"I recently stumbled upon this appealing website that enables users to build social lists. “How can you make a list social?” you might ask. Well, List.ly allows users to collaborate on lists, leave comments on list items, share lists across various social networks, and more. Developer Shyam Subramanyan created this service about one month ago from today. He noticed that a large portion of blog posts are lists, and wanted a way for content creators to create interactive lists that engaged the reading community and gave posts life long after their publish date. With list.ly, he developed a highly functional solution. Upon signing in to List.ly with your Facebook or Twitter account, you will be greeted with a front page consisting of a list of trending lists. Creating a new list is as easy as hitting the big, orange “Start A List Now” button. You will need to fill out a simple form for the list including a title and a description. You will also have the option to allow comments and guest participation (guests will be able to add to the list) as well as the option to moderate guest participation. Once your list is made, you will be able to populate it with new items. For each item on the list, you can give a name, URL, and a description. A relevant photo will be found and added automatically to each list item.

        "title": "Use Your MacBook&#8217;s Trackpad To Its Fullest Potential",
        "excerpt":" Every MacBook user has most likely grown accustomed to the superb glass trackpad that dominates the bottom portion of the laptop. We have all integrated the multitouch functions into our basic operations. However, what you may not know is that you probably aren’t using the trackpad to its fullest power. Although Apple does provide a few configurable options in the System Preferences app, they do not give you a FULL list of things to change. That’s where this certain little application comes into play. BetterTouchTool is a free application that runs in the background while you use your Mac. It runs with a little icon up in the menu bar, which allows access to its quick menu from which a user can change the preferences, check for updates, donate, send a bug report, or quit the application. This application allows a user to set their own multitouch gestures to do certain tasks like changing the volume, changing the brightness of the screen, and any kind of keyboard shortcut. Now instead of doing a strenuous keyboard shortcut, you can instead do a quick little gesture on the trackpad. Not only do you have to set global shortcuts, you can set them per application. This way you can have the same gesture act differently in different apps! For an example of this, I use this application to allow me to use a ‘pinch out’ and ‘pinch in’ gestures to toggle full-screen mode in VLC (which isn’t a nativly supported gesture). Once you install this, you can do anything with touch gestures. Get creative, and Happy Clicking! (BetterTouchTool download) ","categories": ["Apple","Software"],

        "excerpt":"          A QR code that links to Byte Revel     You&#8217;ve probably seen them on ads, commercials, websites, newspapers, and store windows. They&#8217;re little squares with odd patterns of even smaller black and white squares inside of them. But what are these little buggers? Are they marks of a secret society? Are they signs left behind by aliens? Are they like silly bands, but even less useful? None of those guesses are even remotely close. Quick Response codes, or QR codes for short, are a type of two dimensional barcode that can encode a URL, text, geo coordinates, and more. Originating in Japan, QR codes have been around since 1994 and have recently gained much popularity in the United States and neighboring countries.   One of the reasons that this type of barcode has become so popular is because of the ease and speed of scanning and retrieving data from it. All you have to do is open a corresponding app on your cell phone (or other handheld electronic device with support for QR codes, such as an iPod Touch) and point your camera at it. Your phone will scan the QR code square and display any data found. Some smart phones have the feature built in, while others may require you to download an application from an app store. For iOS users, I suggest an app called &#8220;Scan&#8220;, and for Android users I suggest an app called &#8220;Barcode Generator/Reader&#8220;.           The   To fully understand all the math behind the QR code, you would need to do a lot of studying. However, you can get the gist of it by looking at the following image (courtesy of Wikipedia):           The anatomy of a QR code   Now, the paragraph you have all been waiting for: how to make your own QR codes. There are many applications for personal computers and mobile devices that are able to generate QR codes for you. In addition, there are websites that make generating QR codes quick and simple. I searched long and far for an amazing QR code generator for you guys. I am now able to say that http://qrcode.kaywa.com/ is most likely your best bet for making QR codes on your computer. Another website I found that was capable of quickly making QR codes was Google’s URL shortener, Goo.gl. To use this less self-explanatory service, you must first shorten a URL and then append a “.qr” to the end of the shortened URL. The resulting file is a QR code that corresponds with the URL you shortened. For mobile devices, there are also many apps for generating QR codes. For Android, the same app that I mentioned for scanning QR codes can also be used for generating them (here’s the link so you don’t have to scroll aaaallll the way back up there: Barcode Generator/Reader). For iOS, there’s an app called RedLaser that does a swell job of generating QR codes (and it can scan them as well). I hope you found this post informative and enjoyable. Have fun scanning and generating QR codes! :) ","categories": ["Uncategorized"],

        "title": "How To Tether Your Smartphone To Your Other Devices For Free",
        "excerpt":" As everyone knows, the internet is a vital resource, and it is also fun to play around in. Another thing everyone with a smartphone knows is how wireless carriers (such as AT&amp;T or Verizon Wireless) charge their customers an arm and a leg to tether their phones for internet access on their computers. Although most people know that, what some people don’t know is that there is at least one work-around to get the tethering capabilities for free! Tethering: It is one of the Holy Grails of mobile internet. The ability to use your phone’s cellular network as internet for your computer, seems like magic doesn’t it? And that is is why wireless carriers want to charge you so much for it. They want to make you pay for magic. But seeing as you’re already paying them for unlimited data access on your phone as it is, why not cheat the system a little bit by getting this tethering magic for free? I can tell that you are intrigued by this idea. There are two ways to go about doing this, depending upon what mobile operating system you have on your smartphone.   (The Easy One) Android-   Go to the Marketplace, search for “Easytether Lite”  Download and install that application.  Go here and download the appropriate package for your computer. (Note: If you don’t know whether to get the 32-bit or 64-bit, get the 32-bit)  Install the file you just downloaded on your computer. Follow the on-screen instructions for installation.  Once you do that open the Easytether application on your smartphone.  Follow the instructions and answer the prompts that it presents you with.  When you get to a screen that says something about downloading the drivers, click the checkbox that says “I’ve already downloaded”, and hit “Next”  Once you have set the application up, hook your phone to your computer.  If everything went correctly, your computer should now be using your phone to get on the internet!(The Harder One) iPhone-   Jailbreak your iPhone (if it can be jailbroken on your current firmware)  Once you have jailbroken your iPhone go to the Manage section in Cydia and click Sources  Click “Edit”, then hit the “+” button.  In the prompt that pops up type in “http://cydia.xsellize.com” then hit “Add Source”  A warning may pop up, hit “Add Anyway”  When Cydia gets done updating its sources, head over to the Search tab  Search for MyWi  Find the version from the XSellize repo, and install it  MyWi will allow you to create your own personal wifi hotspot from your iPhone’s cell signalBeing without an iPhone, I have not personally been able to use MyWi, so use at your own discretion.

        "title": "A New Social Network Enters The Game As Google Announces Google+",
        "excerpt":"          A user dragging contacts into Circles     In a blog post published on the official Google blog today, Google announced a new service called the Google+ project. Google+ is Google&#8217;s all-out attempt at a social network that will compete with Facebook. The social network is currently in a &#8220;field trial&#8221; and is only available to a small number of people, but you can hope to get access in the near future (you can sign up to get notified as soon as it gets out at https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googleplus/). The many features of Google+ include Circles, hangouts, sparks, profiles, streams, and a great mobile experience (fittingly dubbed “Google+ Mobile”). You’re probably wondering what a lot of the previously mentioned are, so read on.   Streams Right off the bat, we’re talking about copying Facebook. Streams, or “Walls” if you prefer, are where you can post activity updates, share web content, +1 things (If you aren’t already familiar with +1 buttons, they are essentially a Facebook “Like”), exchange comments, make announcements, et cetera. I reiterate, these streams are very similar to the “walls” you are familiar with on Facebook. Almost anything you can do on a Facebook wall, you can do on a Google+ stream. Plus, there are some features that are unique to Google+’s stream such as versions of the stream based on groups of people.   Sparks   Simply choose a topic that you are interested in, and &#8220;follow&#8221; it. Sparks will aggregate information from around the web into one page. For example, I could search for or follow &#8220;technology&#8221; and be provided with links, videos, and other media and information regarding technology. According to various people who have tried out this feature, the results could use a little work. To summarize, the goal of sparks is to give you information that will help you &#8220;spark&#8221; a conversation with a friend.       Hangouts   Video chat just got a little cooler with hangouts. Similar to a group video conference you might have in Skype or ooVoo, hangouts allow you to have clean and simple group video chats with friends and enemies alike. You can either start your own hangout with a group of friends in one of your circles with the click of a button, or you can join a hangout that your friends have already started.         Circles   Circles and hangouts are two key features that help make Google+ more preferable than Facebook. Circles are Google&#8217;s take on groups. With circles, you can organize your contacts into the default groups (acquaintances, following, family, and friends) or into your own custom group (think geeks, school, work, et cetera). Each of these groups has its own As hinted at above, this is a major improvement on Facebook&#8217;s group system. With Facebook, there is just friends and, well, not friends. In addition to being able to sort your contacts into groups, each group gets a stream page in which you can share media, announce a hangout, organize an event, or anything else you would do with a stream or Facebook wall.         Google+ Mobile   Currently available through the Google+ app for Android (must have Android version 1.8 or newer) and soon to be available through an iOS app (there is a nice mobile web app as of now), Google+ mobile sports a clean interface with almost all the functionality the web version plus some more unique features. One of these unique features is Photos. With Photos, each and every photo you take on your device will be automatically uploaded to a photo archive on Google+. Like Facebook, these uploads are unlimited. Unlike Facebook, Google doesn&#8217;t limit the number of photos per album or the photo size. The same goes for video uploads. Although videos are restricted to 15 minutes in length, they can have a resolution of up to 1080p (Facebook limits users to 720p). Another feature unique to mobile users of Google+ is Huddle. Huddle lets users participate in a group chat with friends in from a certain circle.         Analysis   Last year, Google launched its first attempt at social network. It was called Google Buzz. Buzz was underwhelming, and it looked like Google was out of the game. It appears that Google gained valuable experience since then and Google+ looks very promising. Although somewhat geekier than Facebook, it has many features that are unique to it that would interest many people.       Check out the official Google+ page at http://plus.google.com.

        "title": "Top 10 Programming Languages Based on Prolific Usage",
        "excerpt":"   These Top 10 Programming Languages are based on their prolific usage, which means based on their widespread development and many uses. It is easily arguable to determine your favorite or best, and in no way is this list the official, standard, list, but is nonetheless complete. 1. Java I rank Java as number 1 due to its use in most technology today. 1.1 Billion Desktop computers run Java, All of the Blu-Ray players run Java, and 3 billion Cell Phones run Java. Sure, iOS devices can’t use Java, but that is beside the point. Java is most used in hardcore technology and most hardware devices use Java. Programmer Count: 6.5 million 2. C (includes C++ and Objective-C) C is widely used, and was once the ISO standard. Most programmers learn this as one of their first languages in their linguistic arsenal, and for a good reason. It is easy to learn, and has a plethora of uses. It should be learned before JAVA or C# because it makes the learning process easier. A Good Software To Use C++ With: Shiva 3D 3. C# C#’s capabilities are increasing, due to the fact many people turn towards it in lieu of the increasingly outdated C++. Unity3D utilizes C# (though it also uses Javascript and Boo) and according to a poll on its website, more programmers prefer C# over the other two. It has many capabilities with .NET and Web development also. 4. Python Python is hard on the CPU, and its memory management systems can be somewhat difficult to use, but it is very powerful when used in Web development. But Python is a great language to begin programming with because it is easy to learn and easy to implement. It can also be used for multiple platforms. Python also has a good sense of humor, example: “Spam” and “Eggs” are the equivalent of “foo” and “bar” respectively. 5. Javascript Javascript is like the engine and battery in the car. It makes the car work, as well as all the cool gadgets. It is vital for all Web Developers, and one would realize this if their HTML page is kind of lame. If you aren’t familiar with Javascript, you find a Hello, World! tutorial here. 6. PHP PHP is a clever language. It allows you to create forms and check them in your MySQL databases. Most social networking sites use PHP to encrypt and deliver the code. Rasmus Lerdorf is quite a genius. PHP should be learned after CSS. 7. Ruby/Rails Ruby was created by a Japanese guy named “Matz.” “Matz” fused his 5 favorite languages (Eiffel, SmallTalk, Perl, Lisp, and Ada) to make Ruby. I believe Ruby to be an efficient programming language, but there is much controversy to whether it has any use. Ruby on Rails is a beautiful framework that helped make Twitter what it is. 8. Perl Perl is one of the more dynamic languages used in Web Development and is considered PHP’s half-brother. It is open-source and cross-platform but not object-oriented. It has similar syntax to Ruby (it inspired 1/5th of it) and is one of the 3 languages one  should begin learning (the other 2 are C++ and Python). 9. AJAX AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. Okay, okay stop yelling, I know it is not a “programming language” persay but that has no need for the abusive language you are using. AJAX has a plethora of uses, such as Google Maps, GMail and Flickr. 10. VB.NET** ** Visual Basic.Net is what this is. Many of  you would gasp at the thought of .NET (if you’re a mac, you’d understand) but it is nonetheless easy to learn and easy to implement, making it one of the more used programming languages in the world.   ","categories": ["Programming","Review","Software"],

Header The Header was the part at the beginning of all of the code.             public class HelloWorld {      For all of your JAVA programs, this part is already added at the beginning. “public class” means that the program can be accessed anywhere (doesn’t make a lot of sense, but is necessary.) In this piece of code, the “HelloWorld” happens to also be the name of the class we made. Main Function Main Function is a bit of code almost all of the programming languages used and is put at the beginning of it all. If you are familiar with C++, the Main Function is int main (). The Main Function in JAVA is the following:             public static void main(String[] args) {      It is a bit hard to translate this into an English term and define all the sections.

        "title": "How To Make A Stop Motion Animation Using iMovie",
        "excerpt":"   The other day I decided that it would be a fun project to make a stop motion animation. To quote Wikipedia, stop motion is “an animation technique to make a physically manipulated object appear to move on its own. The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a continuous sequence.” That is, you take a picture, move the object a little bit, take another picture, move the object a little, et cetera, until you think that the sequence of frames would make an interesting animation. You don’t need to figure out much to do just the filming for a stop motion animation, but putting these frames together can pose as a tricky problem. Knowing iMovie probably wouldn’t work that well because it is designed to neatly combine average length video clips into one professional looking video, I did a little bit of research regarding consumer-grade software used to make stop motion animation. It became obvious that the best specialized piece of software for making stop motion animations was iStopMotion. This piece of software costs anywhere from $49.99 to $499.99 (depending on which version of the software you want to buy) and I simply didn’t want to shell out the cash for it. The second piece of software I bumped into was FrameByFrame. FrameByFrame is freeware, so I gave it a try. It’s a little buggy, but it works very well if your animation is very short. My animation was fairly long (738 still frames to be exact). So I decided to just make do with iMovie (I didn’t need to pay extra for it because I already had it). Let me first say that I make this tutorial assuming you are using iMovie ’08, ’09, or ’11. If you don’t already own a copy of iMovie, you can find it in the Mac App store or in the iLife CD that can be purchased at your local Apple store. Anyways, on with the tutorial:   If you haven’t done so already, transfer your photos to a  folder on your computer  Open iMovie  Make a new project by going to File -&gt; New Project  In the window that slides down: give it a name, choose the “None” theme, and make sure that the transitions checkbox is unchecked  click the “Create” button  Go to File -&gt; Project Properties  Click the “Timing” tab (the one with a picture of a stopwatch)  Near the bottom, there is a drop down list labeled “Initial Photo Placement”. Set this to “Fit In Frame”.  Click the “Okay” button  Open the folder that contains all of your pictures and drag them into the project editing area (by default, this area is in the top left and it says “Drag media here to create a new project”  After iMovie is done importing all of your images, hover your mouse over the first image in the project  You should see a blue icon with a little gear on it. Click on it.  In the small menu that pops up, select “Clip Adjustments”  You may want to fiddle with this later on, but, for now, set this to 0.1s  Make sure that the checkbox for “Apply to all stills” is checked  Click the “Done” button  Get a nice preview of your video by hovering your mouse over the first image and hitting the space bar. If you would like to change anything, this is the time to do it.  That’s it. We’re ready to export. There are many options of exporting, and you can see all of them by going to the Share menu.

        "title": "The In B Flat Music Project Takes YouTube Music Collaboration To The Next Level",
        "excerpt":" Two years ago, composer and producer Darren Solomon had a great idea. This idea was a project called “In B Flat”. Darren asked fellow singers and musicians to upload a video to YouTube consisting of a simple noise in B flat. Darren took the best contributions and put them all on one page of a website. The idea is that you can play multiple YouTube videos at once to create an ambient sound. Because each video is in a YouTube player, you can easily start or stop certain sounds and adjust the volume level of any sound. After trying this out for myself, I must say that you can create some amazing music with In B Flat. I especially enjoy playing the vocal track (second one up from the bottom left) along with a few other miscellaneous tracks. I’m quite surprised that no one has tried this with other kinds of music. If there are any musicians out there that are reading this, I encourage you to create your own take on this project with a genre of music such as rock. By now I’m sure that you just want to go and check it out for yourself. Here’s the link: http://www.inbflat.net/ ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Music"],

        "title": "Skype Version 5.2 Released For Mac",
        "excerpt":"Earlier today, a new version of Skype for Mac was released. You probably already have a version of Skype installed in your personal computer or smartphone, but I’ll summarize anyway. Skype is the largest player in the VoIP (voice over internet protocol) game and was recently bought by Microsoft in an 8.5 billion dollar deal. Main features of this nifty application include video chat, text chat, voice chat, and calling to both landlines and cellular phones. With this update comes a number of new features that may change the way you communicate with friends and colleagues such as group screen sharing, easy access to active conversations, and video in the call control bar. Since as long as I can remember, there has always been a simple button that you could press to share your screen during a one-on-one video chat. It worked quite well, and I used it frequently. Although I have never had the need to participate in a group video call, I can understand the need for screen sharing. With it, you can easily share slideshows, give instruction on how to perform certain actions on the computer, and help troubleshoot computer problems. However, there is a catch to this new feature. At least one of the video call participants must have a subscription to Skype Premium. It seems viable that you could split the bill with some fellow Skype users and share one account that you would use to initiate a group video call. If you insist on not paying a dime for Skype, then this new feature is rather useless to you.  Another new feature that will interest you chat enthusiasts is easy access to active conversations. In the sidebar of the chat window, there is now a “Recents” section that will display conversations with recent activity. Below that, there is a link to the history window that displays all conversations no matter how active they are. The last significant feature added in this update is video in the call control bar. When switching to another application during a Skype call, a little window will pop up that will allow you to still see the person you are talking to and access basic controls.

        "title": "How To Link To A Time In A YouTube Video",
        "excerpt":"All of us are familiar with YouTube, the massive video sharing website where you can upload your own videos or view other people’s videos. What some of us may not be familiar with is a feature introduced to YouTube in October of 2008 that allows users to link to a a specific time in a video. The rough and dirty way is to add “#t=” to the end of the URL of the YouTube video followed by a specification of time into the video you want to link to. For example, if I wanted to make a link that would take you 45 seconds in to the Numa Numa video, I would append “#t=45s” to “http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk” and get “http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmtzQCSh6xk#t=45s“. If you click on that link, you will find that it takes you to the 45 second mark of the YouTube video. If the video was on the longer side, like the complete video coverage of the 2011 WWDC Apple keynote address, I could append a time in minutes instead of, or in addition to, seconds. That is, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lsMFzxtSZ8#t=34m23s would take you 34 minutes and 23 seconds into the video. Now you might think that this is a hassle. Well, there are alternative ways of generating a link to a time in a video. The easiest way is probably right clicking on the video player and selecting “Copy video URL at current time”. This will generate a link to the corresponding time in the video and copy it to your clipboard. Alternatively, head on over to http://youtubetime.com/ and fill out the simple form and you will be provided with the link to the time you specify.           Right click the video and click \"Copy URL at current time\"             http://youtubetime.com/   Enjoy! ","categories": ["Google","How To"],

        "title": "Facebook Announced Video Chat In Partnership With Skype",
        "excerpt":" Yesterday, Mark Zuckerberg  invited media reporters to the Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto. The reason, he said, was for an awesome product launch. During his 45 minute presentation, he announced a new chat design, group chat, and, most significantly, Facebook video chat (made possible with Skype). That’s right, Facebook is buddying up with Skype to provide users with one-on-one video calling. Video chat services like Skype, ooVoo, and Gmail video chat have been around for a long time. In that sense, this announcement is insignificant. However, many people already use Facebook, making the need to sign up for a new account on another service unnecessary. Also, many users of Facebook aren’t very tech-savvy and setting up an application like Skype might bewilder them. Facebook video chat would make it possible for people like that to have access to the fun and useful technology that is video chat. It is interesting that this update comes very soon after Google announced Google+. Google+ boasts both group video chat and one-on-one video chat. Perhaps this announcement is Facebook’s response to the features that Google+ has that Facebook lacked. In addition, Google+ already has group chat and group chat comes as part of Zuckerberg’s announcement. Is this announcement a coincidence? I think not. The last thing to make note of is that Facebook’s new video chat is ONLY for one-on-one calls, and Google+ allows for both group calls and one-on-one calls. This is probably because the new video chat relies on Skype technology and services in order to work. Users of Skype probably know that group calls are only available to premium members. What is your take on the new video chat on the mighty Facebook? Do you love it? Hate it? Really don’t care? Comment! ","categories": ["Hot News","Social Networking"],

        "title": "YouTube Tests A Brand New User Interface",
        "excerpt":"YouTube announced by blog post yesterday that they are testing out a new user interface called “Cosmic Panda”. Users of the popular video sharing service can try out this new interface by heading on over to http://www.youtube.com/cosmicpanda and hitting the “Try It Out” button. This redesign follows those of Gmail and Google Calendar. Overall, the new interface sports a darker color scheme as well as larger icons and buttons (ie. simpler). Channel interfaces are also greatly redone with the option to choose one of four templates. Each of these templates is focused at a different type of video publisher such as blogger, creator, and network. There is also an everything layout for people who publish a wide variety of videos.  Another new feature that I really enjoy is that videos continue playing in a neat little bar at the top of the page  when you browse through other channels. For example, if you are watching the famous Double Rainbow music video and you click on your username in the top right corner, the Double Rainbow video will play in a litte bar at the top of the page while you browse your own channel.  When viewing a video, you will notice that the player has the same features as the old player, but they are presented in a different way. Video size options are displayed by means of four buttons that are arranged in a horizontal bar under the video. If the video is part of a playlist, then the bar of videos in the playlist is displayed directly under the video. Like the mobile version of YouTube, comments or suggested videos can be displayed under the video player depending on which of two buttons is pressed under the video player. Like in the old version of YouTube, suggested videos are displayed along the right side of the comments.  I really like the new, elegant interface and hope that it will be officially implemented site-wide. What do you think about it? Do you like it? Comment!   ","categories": ["Google","Hot News"],

        "title": "Google+ Does Not Allow Minors",
        "excerpt":" Google’s new social networking service, Google Plus, has been growing really popular these days despite it not being available to users without an invitation. As many might have noticed, Google+ has quite a lot of similarities with Facebook, the only impressive feature of it being the Circles that are basically the core of all Google+. So, what else is different from Facebook? Apparently, trying to sign up to Google+ as a minor has an unexpected result:                     This feature is not available for your account                          You must be over a certain age to use this feature.            This is very interesting. It reminds me of the recent trouble Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of Facebook) had on the G8 summit related to users under 13 years that use Facebook. This is actually a huge difference from Facebook since Zuckerberg, speaking in front of the world leaders has asked the officials to “refrain from excessive internet regulation”. Zuckerberg said regulation would not work and that the leaders should instead invest in “high-speed technology”. Google’s measure is pretty drastic. Thirteen years is one thing, eighteen is another. Of course, using another account with a different birthday is possible, and Google Plus is still not open to everybody so things might change until then, but Google’s approach on this matter is very interesting, especially since social networking websites are very popular among teenagers. What is Google trying to do? Why not allow minors to use it? I would love to know what you guys think, so leave a comment below. ","categories": ["Google","Social Networking"],

        "excerpt":"Khan Academy is a website that contains Free Instructional and Teaching Videos that range from teaching Biology to Economics to Algebra. It has been sponsored heavily by Bill Gates who supports this website, which is peculiar because there is a sackful of websites that have teaching services and a handful with free teaching services. One of the main reasons Bill Gates supports this website over others is due to the fact it has 2,400 videos (totaling 60 million views) all created by 1 person. That’s right! 1 person runs the entire “Khan Academy.” Salman Khan Salman Khan is the man behind all of the 2400 videos. Salman Khan is from a Bengali heritage, but lived in the US. He graduated his High School as its valedictorian and went on to Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. At M.I.T., he received an MS in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, BS in Electrical Engineering, and a BS in Mathematics. At Harvard, he received an MBA. Sounds educated, huh? Well, according to the video on his website, Salman Khan was tutoring his cousins when he had the idea of constructing a website where he could teach people around the world. Everything went uphill from there; He received a $2 million grant from Google, full sponsorship from Bill Gates, and some other awards.  So, what are you waiting for?

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 2 &#8211; Variables And Data Types",
        "excerpt":"     In our last Objective-C tutorial, we covered setting up Xcode, running the Hello World program, and making comments. In this tutorial, we are going to go over variables. If you went through any basic algebra course, then you probably know what a mathematical variable is. As a quick reminder, a variable is a letter or symbol that represents a  value (or values). The value of a variable can change given different equations. In programming, variables are names that are placeholders for a data value. For example, a variable named “x” could represent 5. There are many different types of variables for different kinds of data values. For example, integer variables can only represent numbers that are integers (integers are pretty much whole numbers like -1, 0, and 1). Floats, or floating point numbers, are variables that represent numbers that can have decimal places (up to 7 digits total). A double is a variable type like a float, but it  can hold a much larger amount of digits. When displaying a double in the console window, scientific notation is used for numbers with more than 6 decimal places. Now I know that this paragraph is somewhat confusing and difficult to reference, so here is a comprehensive chart of data values that you can look over now, and back at in the future.             Date Type                  Description                  Example(s)                    int                  variables that are integers can store whole numbers                  -1, 0, 1                    float                  variables that are floats can store numbers with (a limited) number of decimals                   3.14, 5.68, 2.333                    double                  variables that are doubles can store a very large amount of decimals and are displayed in scientific notation                   3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944                     char                   variables that are characters can store a letter                   a, b, c                    bool                  a variable that is either true or false; boolean values are integers; any number that is not 0 is true, 0 is false                  true, false, 0, 1, 2                    id                  id variables can store any type of data as well as entire objects                   &#8220;hello&#8221;, 1, pool        Don’t worry if you don’t understand some of these data types, we will be going over the use of integers right now, and the others we will cover in the future. It’s time do dive right in to the code. In this program, we will declare a variable “x” and set it equal to 3. Then, we will output the value of x using NSLog.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 3;            NSLog(@\"The value of x is %i\", x);            [pool drain];            return 0;            }        If you run the program (see tutorial 1), you will find that it outputs “The value of x is 3”. Pretty darn amazing, eh? Now lets break it down and go through the lines of code that you haven’t sen before. int x = 3; This sets the integer variable x to equal the value 3. It can also be typed as follows:             int x;            x = 3;        NSLog(@”The value of x is %i”, x); This NSLog statement outputs “The value of x is 3”. In order to output the value of an integer variable (in this case, x) in the NSLog statement, you must place %i in the part of the output (text in parenthesis) where you want the variable to be output. Then, you must follow the output statement in quotes by a comma and the name of the variable that you want the %i to represent (in this case, it was x). Now, let’s look at some situations that you might run into while using variables. Say you want to output the values of two variables in the same NSLog statement. The code would be as follows:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 3;            int y = 12;            NSLog(@\"The value of x is %i, and the value of y is %i\", x, y);            [pool drain];            return 0;            }        This will output “The value of x is 3, and the value of y is 12”. NSLog(@”The value of x is %i, and the value of y is %i”, x, y); The two %i’s correspond to the variables that are in the same place in order in the list of variables after the quotation. Another interesting thing you can do with variables is set a variable to equal an equation that can include other variables. The following code demonstrates this:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 3;            int y = 12;            int z = x + y;            NSLog(@\"The sum of x and y is %i\", z);            [pool drain];            return 0;            }        This outputs “The sum of x and y is 15”. The line “int z = x + y;” sets integer variable z to equal the sum of the values of x and y. The last thing I want to demonstrate is the use of a different data type. Let’s use a float.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            float x = 3.1415;            NSLog(@\"The value of x is %f\", x);            [pool drain];            return 0;            }        This outputs “The value of x is 3.141500”. Note how all 6 decimals are displayed, even if you didn’t have that many. Also note that we used %f in our NSLog statement to output a float. For doubles, we use %e. We will discuss the use of other variables in NSLog in future tutorials. I hope that you found this tutorial helpful!

        "title": "15 Billion iOS App Downloads And Counting",
        "excerpt":" Apple recently made available to the press a new app store statistic. Namely, over 15 billion apps have been downloaded  from the iOS app store so far. That’s about 386 apps every second, or 23,160 apps per minute . IS THAT CRAZY OR… wait… it’s not? This  actually won’t surprise most people who keep track of Apple’s activity even casually, as the success of the app store has been obvious since month one. The massive number of apps that has been available to iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad users is a large factor in the platform’s popularity, even going so far as to stay ahead of Google’s promising Android operating system. Apple also put emphasis on the following already known statistics:   425,000+ apps are in the app store  100,000+ of these apps are native iPad apps  200+ million users of iDevices worldwide  $2.5 billion has been paid to developersDon’t let the number fool you. Although 15 billion apps would be enough for 2 for every person on Earth, they are obviously not spread out evenly. I, for one, have over 350 apps on my iPod Touch. Most of them I only opened once, and then they were left, forever forgotten. I would guess that there are a large number of iOS users like me that download an absurd number of apps that are rarely ever looked at. Let’s take a look at the history of the App Store. It was first released on iOS version 2 on July 10, 2008. By July 14 of 2008, there were 10 million app downloads. On october 22 of 2008, there were 200 million. The next year, in July 14 of 2009, there were 1.5 billion. On November 4th of 2009, there were 2 billion. June 7th of 2010, 5 billion. This January, the 10 billionth app was downloaded (they even had a countdown and $10,000 prize for it). And now, July of 2011, 15 billion downloads. Wow. In second place comes the Android market with a mere 5 billon app downloads to date. Impressive, but not nearly as many as the app store. Chances are this has something to do with the relatively small (150,000) collection of apps in the Android market. People like quantity and variety. It is also important to take into account that iOS was released a full 6 months before Android. That’s 6 extra months to gain more users. However, the rate at which new Android apps are released surpasses that of the App Store quite a bit. In fact, the number of Android apps will probably outnumber iOS apps by late 2012. Although this is the case, Apple regulates apps that make it into the store, while Google lets anything in. The quality of apps suffers. The last thing I want to point out has to do with a study done by Nielson. The average iOS user spends about 14.7 hours a month playing games, while the average mobile device user plays for about 7.8 hours a month. That’s saying something. One reason this is the case probably has something to do with the percentage of apps in the App store that are games. That percentage is 64% to be exact. Another thing that likely contributes to the popularity of games in the app store is the demographic of many iOS users. That is, many iOS users are minors. More so than Android users. Below is the word-for-word press release published by Apple:                               Apple’s App Store Downloads Top 15 Billion                                   CUPERTINO, California—July 7, 2011—Apple® today announced that over 15 billion apps have been downloaded from its revolutionary App Store™ by the more than 200 million iPhone®, iPad® and iPod touch® users worldwide. The App Store offers more than 425,000 apps and developers have created an incredible array of over 100,000 native iPad apps.                                   “In just three years, the revolutionary App Store has grown to become the most exciting and successful software marketplace the world has ever seen,” said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing. “Thank you to all of our amazing developers who have filled it with over 425,000 of the coolest apps and to our over 200 million iOS users for surpassing 15 billion downloads.”                                   “We sparked musical magic when iPhone users experienced Ocarina three years ago,” said Dr. Ge Wang, a Smule co-founder and assistant professor at Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics. “And now with iPad, we’ve created the Magic Piano and Magic Fiddle apps. Who could’ve dreamt an iPad would make its way into the San Francisco Symphony?”                                   “iPad provides us with an unparalleled mobile device for creating gorgeous, immersive games,” said Mark Rein, vice president and co-founder of Epic Games. “Infinity Blade has been a runaway hit with customers around the world and we couldn’t be more excited about our success on iOS devices.”                                   “We’re bringing Martha Stewart, Angelina Ballerina, Sesame Street and many more of the world’s most popular books and magazines to iPad,” said Nicholas Callaway, CEO of Callaway Digital Arts. “We knew the iPad was going to be a revolutionary storytelling device, but never could have anticipated it would become so popular, so quickly.”                                   More than 15 billion apps have been downloaded from the revolutionary App Store and more than 425,000 apps are available, including more than 100,000 native iPad apps, to consumers in 90 countries. Users of the more than 200 million iOS devices around the world can choose from an incredible range of apps in 20 categories, including games, business, news, education, sports, health, reference and travel. Apple has paid developers over $2.5 billion to date.                                   Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store.

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 3 &#8211; If Else Statements And Basic Looping",
        "excerpt":" And it’s time for a shiny, new Objective-C tutorial! In our last tutorial, we covered variables and data types. In this tutorial, we will be covering the famous if else statements as well as loops. Enjoy!   The if-else Statement So what exactly is an if else statement? It is a statement that allows the computer to test a condition and execute a chunk of code if it is true, or execute a different chunk of code if it is false. Here’s a picture that might help you grasp the concept:  Now if we translate that diagram into objective-c, we get:             if (condition) {            //true commands            }            else {            //false commands            }        Now that code won’t run on it’s own, so let’s add some structure and content:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 2;            if (x &lt; 5) {            NSLog(@\"X is less than 5\");            }                else {            NSLog(@\"X is equal to or greater than 5\");            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        This program will output “X is less than 5” because, well, X is less than 5. Let’s now go through the if else statement in our program. if (x &lt; 5) { The “if” statement begins the if else statement. In it, declare it an if statement and give a condition. The condition is given in the parenthesis and is, in this case, “x&lt;5”. If x is less than 5, then the code inside the curly brackets of the if statement will be run. NSLog(@”X is less than 5″); This is the code that will be run if the condition that is declared in the if statement is true. else { The “else” statement ends the if else statement. We simply declare it by typing “else” and start the body of it with a curly bracket. The code that is in the curly brackets of the else statement is what will be run if the condition declared in the parenthesis of the if statement is false. NSLog(@”X is equal to or greater than 5″); This is the code that will be run if the condition that is declared in the if statement is false. If we change the value of x from 2 to 7, then the code inside the else statement will be run because the condition x &lt; 5 will be false. That is:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 7;            if (x&lt;5) {            NSLog(@\"X is less than 5\");            }                else {            NSLog(@\"X is equal to or greater than 5\");            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        This program will output “X is equal to or greater than 5″ because the value of x, 7, is greater than 5. That makes the condition ” x &lt; 5″ false.   The While Loop Okay, now that we have gone over the basic if else statement, let’s get to some loops! A loop is a block of code that is repeated until or while a particular condition is satisfied. First, let’s go over the while loop. A while loop is a loop that runs a block of code over and over until a specified condition is true. Here’s another image that may help you grasp the concept:  The computer checks to see if a condition is true. If it is, then a block of code in the while loop is run. If it isn’t, then the code isn’t run. Every time the block of code runs, the same process occurs. Any questions should clear up after we go over this next bit of code:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int x = 20;            while (x &gt;= 10) {            NSLog(@\"%i\", x);            x = x - 1;            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        This program will output “20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10” (each number on a new line). As usual, we’re going to go through the new code that you haven’t seen before (if you don’t understand a line that I leave unmentioned, look at previous tutorials). while (x &gt;= 10) { This line starts the while loop by declaring the loop “while” and giving a condition. In this case, the condition is “x is less than or equal to 10” . As long as the value of x is less than or equal to the value of 10, the code inside the curly brackets will be run. It is important to make sure that the code inside the curly brackets changes the value of a variable in the condition so that the code doesn’t run infinitely. x = x – 1; All we’re doing here is setting x equal to be one less than the current value. This can also be written as:             x--;      The reason we are setting the value of x to be one less is so that the while loop doesn’t run infinitely. Eventually, x is no longer greater than or equal to 10.   The For Loop The next loop we are going to go over is the “for” loop. This is the most complicated, so pay close attention! A for loop is useful if you want to run some lines of code a certain number of times.  As usual, here’s some code with a for loop that we will go over:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int y;            for (y = 0; y &lt;= 20; y = y + 1) {            NSLog(@\"%i\", y);            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        This program will output the numbers 1 through 20 to the console window. for (y = 0; y &lt;= 20; y = y + 1) { The for loop is declared with “for” (I bet you didn’t see that coming!) and  is followed by three expressions in parenthesis. The first expression (in this case “y=0;”)  sets a variable equal to something as a starting point. Notice how we declared the variable “y” before the for loop. Instead of doing that we can declare the variable and set its value right inside this expression. (like this: ” for (int y = 0; y&lt;=20; y = y + 1″)” ). Now, as I mentioned previously, this is only a starting point. The second expression sets a limit on the value of the variable. In the case of this program, out limit is ” y &lt;= 20″. That is, as long as y is less than or equal to 20, the code inside the loop will run. It would seem that the code inside the loop would then run forever, but this is where the third expression kicks in. The third expression manipulates the value of the variable in some way so that the limit set in expression 2 is eventually reached. The most common things to do with the value is either increase it by one (which is what the third expression in this program does) or decrease it by one. Similarly to how “x = x – 1” is the same thing as “x–;” (as mentioned in the explanation of the while loop), “y = y + 1” can be re-written as “y++”. To summarize, the first expression sets the value of the variable, the second sets a limit on the value of the variable, and the third changes the value of the variable so that it eventually reaches the limit. NSLog(@”%i”, y); You’ve seen this before, but I want to point a couple of things out. The first being that this is the code in our for loop that is run a certain number of times (in this case, 20). The second is that this is a useful way of increasing the value of a variable by a certain amount each time a chunk of code is run. You can use the same variable in your loop as the one used in the expressions.   The Do While Loop   The last loop that I want to go over in this tutorial is the do while loop. The do while loop is very similar to the while loop but with one major difference. That difference is that the code inside the loop is run once before the condition is tested. If you don&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m saying look at the following image:   Now compare that to the diagram of the while loop, and you should see the difference. Now, let&#8217;s study some more code:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int z = 10;            do {            NSLog(@\"%i\", z);            z = z - 1;            } while (z &gt;= 0);            [pool drain];                return 0;            }      do { That’s all there is to declaring a do while loop. The “do” declares the do part of the do while loop and the opening curly bracket opens/starts the loop. z = z – 1; I know that this is probably getting annoying, but I want to mention this one last time. This line can also be written “z- -;” } while (z &gt;= 0); The closing curly bracket closes/ends the loop body. Now this is where the while part of the do while loop comes in. After the “do” code is run, the while condition is checked and, if it is true, the “do” code will be run again. If it is false, than the program will continue and the “do” code won’t be run again. Take note that there is a semicolon after the condition (expression in parenthesis).   Some more information regarding operators&#8230; Now that we’ve covered most of the loops, I would like to provide a little more information regarding conditions. You probably gathered most of the information you need to know from the above code, but I’m going to clarify anyway. There are 6 different comparison operators that you can use to compare two values/ variables, and here they are:             Operator                  In words                  Example                    &lt;                  Is less than                  X &lt; 5                    &gt;                  Is greater than                  X &gt; 5                    ==                  Is equal to                  X == 5                    !=                  Is not equal to                  X != 5                    &lt;=                  Is less than or equal to                  X &lt;= 5                    &gt;=                  Is greater than or equal to                  X &gt;= 5      Now say you want to have multiple conditions that have to be met in order for a chunk of code in a loop or an if else statement to be run. Well, you can insert “&amp;&amp;”  between the conditions in the parenthesis and all of them will be checked. This is referred to as the AND operator. Here’s an example:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int n = 10;            if (n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; n &lt; 20) {            NSLog(@\"n is between 0 and 20!\");            }            else {            NSLog(@\"n is not betwen 0 and 20\");            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        See if you can figure out what will be output by looking at the code.             Okay, now say that you have multiple conditions and you want at least one of them to be true. You would want to use the OR operator. It is typed like this: “             ”. Like the AND operator, the OR operator is is placed between the expressions like so:                  #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            int n = 15;            if (n == 10 || n == 20) {            NSLog(@\"n is equal to either 10 or 20\");            }            else {            NSLog(@\"n is not equal to 10 or 20\");            }            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        Like the previous code, I suggest you test yourself and se if you can figure out what the output will be. Well, that’s all for now. See you next tutorial!   ","categories": ["Objective-C"],

        "title": "Music Streaming Service Spotify Is Now Available In The U.S. !",
        "excerpt":"  Spotify, the most popular music streaming service in Europe, is now available in the United States! First introduced in late 2008 to seven countries in Europe, Spotify allows users to access a library of over 15 million songs and organize them into playlists, share them with friends, and listen to &#8220;radio stations&#8221; that play music based on a user&#8217;s taste. Currently, Spotify is 10 million users strong, 1.6 million of those being paid subscribers. You can sign up for one of three tiers when creating an account. Those being free, unlimited, and premium. Spotify Free users will have a listening cap (starting 6 months from now; unlimited until then), and will have to sit through some ads. The unlimited plan goes for $4.99 a month, and allows for unlimited access and no ads. The premium plan goes for a reasonable $9.99 per month, and includes the features of the Unlimited plan, plus unlimited access on your mobile devices and an offline mode for playlists. Before you start scrambling for a free account, you should know that there is currently a small catch. Namely, you have to have an invitation to get in. You can get on the mail list for invitations by visiting http://www.spotify.com/us/hello-america/. If you happen to know somebody that is signing up for a premium account, you can beg them for one of their 5 invites that they can give out. I repeat, you only need an invite if you want a free account. The launch of Spotify in the U.S. follows a vicious battle between Spotify and major record companies. This is what prevented them from letting people in the U.S. join since the initial release of Spotify in October of 2008. Spotify now claims successful negotiation with four major record companies, giving them the rights to share 15 million tracks with users. Obviously, the artists have to get paid for their hard work, and Spotify paid out $60 million in royalties just last year. What does Spotify mean for the pay-per-download music market that companies such as  Apple and Amazon run? Well, there are clashing views. Many music industry executives believe that the music download market will still stand strong for years to come, while other critics see Spotify as the end of the music download business.

        "title": "Cocos2D For iPhone Tutorial 2 &#8211;  Make A Sprite (Not The Drink!)",
        "excerpt":"   Okay, now that you’ve successfully installed Cocos2D for iPhone, let’s go over making a project and displaying a sprite. First off, we need to create a new project. This is done by opening Xcode and going to File -&gt; New Project. Alternatively, Hit the “Create a new Xcode project” button in the welcome window. In the new project window, select “Cocos2d” from the user templates section of the sidebar. The type of application that you want to make right now is a “cocos2d Application”. Double click the corresponding icon. In your project sidebar, expand the “Classes” folder. The file that we are going to work with in this tutorial is “HelloWorldScene.m”. Click it. Be default, the code should be as follows:             //  HelloWorldLayer.m&lt;/p&gt;             // Import the interfaces            #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"            // HelloWorld implementation            @implementation HelloWorld            +(id) scene            {            // 'scene' is an autorelease object.            CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];            // 'layer' is an autorelease object.            HelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];            // add layer as a child to scene            [scene addChild: layer];            // return the scene            return scene;            }            // on \"init\" you need to initialize your instance            -(id) init            {            // always call \"super\" init            // Apple recommends to re-assign \"self\" with the \"super\" return value            if( (self=[super init] )) {            // create and initialize a Label            CCLabelTTF *label = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Hello World\" fontName:@\"Marker Felt\" fontSize:64];            // ask director the the window size            CGSize size = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] winSize];            // position the label on the center of the screen            label.position =  ccp( size.width /2 , size.height/2 );            // add the label as a child to this Layer            [self addChild: label];            }            return self;            }            // on \"dealloc\" you need to release all your retained objects            - (void) dealloc            {            // in case you have something to dealloc, do it in this method            // in this particular example nothing needs to be released.            // cocos2d will automatically release all the children (Label)            // don't forget to call \"super dealloc\"            [super dealloc];            }            @end      To make sure Cocos2D is configured correctly, click “Build and Debug” (at the top of the window). The iOs simulator application should open, and the Cocos2D application should run. The default code will cause “Hello World” to be displayed on the screen. All is well? Good. After getting rid of all the unnecessary parts of code in our HelloWorldScene.m file, such as comments, we can trim it down to:             #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"            @implementation HelloWorld            +(id) scene            {            CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];            HelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];            [scene addChild: layer];            return scene;            }            -(id) init            {            if( (self=[super init] )) {            }            return self;            }            - (void) dealloc            {            [super dealloc];            }            @end        Before we get to writing the code that will display a sprite, let’s make sure we know what a sprite is. The definition of a sprite is “A computer graphic that may be moved on-screen and otherwise manipulated as a single entity”. For example, in Angry Birds, the birds that you launch with a slingshot are sprites. Now that we’ve got that over with, let’s get back to the project. Obviously, we are going to need a sprite that we can manipulate. Luckily, there is a default Cocos2D icon in the “Resources” folder in the sidebar that we can use. If you’re really against using that, then you can import your own small png image to the Resources folder and adjust the code that we go through accordingly. For the purpose of this tutorial, though, we are going to use the default image “Icon.png”. Let’s cut to the code (I love saying that). We’re going to start off by making an object for our sprite. We do this by making an object in the class “CCSprite”. Let’s call our object “icon” because that’s the name of the image we are using. The code for this is “CCSprite *icon;”.  “Where do I put this?” you ask. Glad you asked. We are going to put this right under the #import code. Like so:             #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"            CCSprite *icon;            @implementation HelloWorld            +(id) scene            {            CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];            HelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];            [scene addChild: layer];            return scene;            }            -(id) init            {            if( (self=[super init] )) {            }            return self;            }            - (void) dealloc            {            [super dealloc];            }            @end      Because we declared our object outside of the methods, all of the methods will be able to access it. While this isn’t of real importance right now, it will become necessary when our code becomes more complicated. The next thing we need to do is connect our icon.png file to our object “icon” and tell the iOS simulator where to place the image on the screen. The section of code that we are going to work in is the “init” method (look at the above code for “-(id) init”). The init method is what is run/initialized when a scene is loaded (we’ll go over scenes in a future tutorial, but you can probably figure out what they are by their name). It’s unnecessary for me to show the code in the rest of the program, so the next bit of code will only be the init method (you will want to add this to the init method in the code above).             -(id) init            {            if( (self=[super init] )) {            icon = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@\"Icon.png\"];            icon.position = ccp(300,200);            [self addChild:icon];            }            return self;            }        icon = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@”Icon.png”]; This line of code sets the image file of the sprite. You would change the object name (in this case, “icon”) depending on the name of your object. Also, the name of the image file would change depending on what the name of the image in your Resources folder is called. icon.position = ccp(300,200); You can’t just tell a computer to stick an image on the screen and expect it to go where you want it to. This code specifies the coordinates of the image. In the case of Cocos2D, the origin of the coordinate plane is the bottom left corner of the iPhone or iPod Touch screen. The coordinate itself refers to the location of the exact center of the sprite/image. [self addChild:icon]; This simply adds the icon sprite to the current layer. We’ll go over layers and their many uses in a future tutorial.   That&#8217;s it. Click “Run and Debug” and watch the Cocos2D icon sit at the coordinates (300,200) on your virtual iPhone screen!      For practice (and to test your understanding), I suggest you try adding multiple sprites with different images to the screen. ","categories": ["Cocos2D"],

        "title": "What to Expect When Beginning iPhone App Development",
        "excerpt":"I write this article for those of you who are getting excited with the app development craze and want to jump on the bandwagon as an individual developer. For those of you who have been programming for sometime or programmed with a company for some time, this article carries little advice for you all. So app development seems to be a straightforward plan, but can get quite convoluted if you have had no experience with any of the development processes. But this development can be simplified to a basic 3 major parts; Brainstorm, Development, and Release. Brainstorm  So when developing an iPhone app, you need to have 4 objectives plotted; you need to find out what the product does, whom this would appeal to, how it would be developed, and the development plausibility. This can apply to all game development/application developments.   The product’s objective is most important, as it is basically what the product does. If it is a video game, it is meant to entertain. If it is a Utility, it is meant to make one’s life just a bit easier and more manageable. Once the objective of the product is developed, you could proceed to figure out the logistics of the plausibility.  If you created a Pink Unicorn Rainbow (I’m stereotyping here but it makes a point) app that is really a Medicinal guide to Chinese Pharmaceuticals, people will scoff at the app (except those Chinese people who dig Unicorn Rainbows). If you created a game so similar to Angry Birds that the only difference is the spelling (Angree Byrdz), you’ll lose a lot of credibility really quickly. So you have to make a game that appeals to the masses, but is very unique. This can be quite hard, and is one of the reasons App Brainstorming can be quite fickle.  How a game/app will be developed is a very difficult process. See below in “Development” for a further explanation  Development plausibility refers to the complexity of a game/app that is to be developed. If a game requires too much work to develop, or requires the utilization of a self-made graphics engine to make the game work; it wouldn’t be efficient nor plausible.  This all demands the developer (you, perhaps) to stick to certain terms that would make the brainstorming process original,  focused, not too far-fetched, and plausible. This may make your objective very narrow, but consider it a passage into a universe of ideas. Take a sonnet for example. It has very strict scheme of writing that almost seems arbitrary; 10 beats per line, rhyme scheme, 12 lines total&#8230; But other than those parameters, you can accomplish so much in a sonnet. Now with that in mind, begin your brainstorming process.  The following tools may appear obvious but could be useful when brainstorming:            Notebook (to store ideas)              Graph Paper (to graph the interface)              Blank iPhone Templates (see below to copy)              White Boards (allows you to deal with the idea more tangibly)                                    iPhone Template to Begin Designing        Okay, so you&#8217;ve got the brainstorming bit down? Good. The next part is when things get really trippy and obscure.  Development  Yeah, I wasn&#8217;t joking. Development is the longest part and is what trips people up the most. It requires complete discipline in sticking to the brainstorm. It also requires intense coding, graphical design, hissy fits (not necessary) and getting frustrated at a bug that doesn&#8217;t make sense until you&#8217;ve realized you hit the space bar twice.  With that being said, let&#8217;s look at how fun it is!  When developing, you need to look at 3 major aspects; the coding, the graphics, and the SDK. There are some SDK&#8217;s that have the graphics capabilities in them (such as Unity) so those two may overlap. So, let&#8217;s look at Coding first.  Coding  This obscure process involves the knowledge of different types of code. If you are using the iPhone SDK by itself and using OpenGL for the graphics, you&#8217;ll need to be familiar with Objective-C. If you plan to use an all-in-one SDK, such as Shiva3D or Blender, you&#8217;ll need to know C++ and Python respectively. If you are planning to use Unity (which I recommend. It&#8217;s a great software), then you must be familiar with Python (so you could learn Boo), Javascript, and C#.  Since there is a lot of learning to be done, if you haven&#8217;t learned any of these languages yet, you should check out Apress. They have a very large variety of books that range from learning Puppet to learning Unity3D. The book at Apress are very extensive and extremely useful and instructive when learning a new programming language.  Graphics  Graphics can be the most entertaining part of iPhone Development (or any software development) as it can be one of the least stressful. But in some cases, it could be quite the opposite. That is why you should be quite familiar with the graphics platform you are using to make your game/app. Here is a list of commercial and free graphics engines that you should look into: (thanks to iPodNerd for the list)  FREE      http://sio2interactive.com/index.php          http://maniacdev.com/2009/08/the-open-source-iphone-game-engine-comparison/          http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/          http://gamesalad.com/ (I know, I know&#8230; Gamesalad is bogus but potentially useful)          COMMERCIAL                http://maniacdev.com/2009/09/the-commercial-iphone-game-engine-comparison-3d-and-2d/                  http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/                  http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-2d                  SDK                  The SDK you are going to use depends a lot on your idea. If your idea is just going to be using OpenGL, chances are you must be a very patient person and don&#8217;t have to buy any other software. But if you are going to make a physics game, I recommend Corona SDK. If you are planning for a test or prototype game, you should use Gamesalad (in my opinion, Gamesalad is bogus and cheating but what the hay). You should contemplate your game&#8217;s objective before you choose an SDK to work with.                  Release                  Release can be an interesting process. Release also requires your game to be thoroughly checked for bugs, glitches, memory management, memory allocation, and, once again, plausibility. So make sure your game has been checked and works just fine on your testing devices. Then, you can begin the process of release.              With the expanse of apps out on the iPhone app store, how would your app get noticed? Well, you could pay thousands of dollars to various ad agencies and get your app noticed or you can take advantage of your resources that happen to be FREE!                        YouTube &#8211; Post videos of your app on YouTube. But these videos cannot be just shabbily put together of the mundane parts of the app. They have to show the exciting parts with bright graphics and very clean interface. One cannot simply (you think I&#8217;m going to say &#8220;walk into Mordor&#8221; don&#8217;t you? :)) make any video. They must put together a great graphical experience for the viewer.                    App Reviewers &#8211; There are many app reviewers on YouTube that are willing to review your app for you. Since you have 50 FREE codes which you can give to people to download your app for free, you can give them to 50 different reviewers who will gladly look over your app. Now this may make your app look bad if the reviewer is a sour grape or if the app is actually bad, but you can always downplay the weaknesses by making your own reviews anonymously. I know this sounds bad but it will help your app get noticed.                    An Aesthetically Clean Website &#8211; If you make a website for your app or app company, that will make your company seem a bit more reputable. Mind you that these websites cannot be made using Free Webs and will cost you money, you will put forth a great view of your app. But make sure that the website is clean and informative of your app so you don&#8217;t give the wrong impression of disorganized and cheap.                    Finally, the Summary &#8211; When you release an app, you write a summary about it. Make sure your summary is extensive as can be (milk out every detail of the game) and the screenshots of the game are the best screenshots possible.                    Now you have glimpsed what it is like to develop an app successfully. The process may seem obscure and overwhelming but fear not! Steve Demeter of Demiforce made Trism and has made $250,000 in the first 2 months that he released his app. Smule was a company started at Stanford and now practically dominates the musical instrument industry in the app store. There are many people who have become successful by utilizing the iOS app store. So, fear not, and happy coding!  ","categories": ["App Development","Apple","How To","iOS","Programming","Software"],

        "title": "An Excellent Source of Physical Geographic Terms &#8211; PhysicalGeography.net",
        "excerpt":"When studying or researching geography, it can be quite troublesome when trying to determine geographic terms or searching for geographic terms (By geographic terms, I am referring to “island” or “graben” or “moraine” not “Serbia”). Dictionaries prove to be too convoluted and can be too difficult to pinpoint the exact geographic terms you are looking for. PhysicalGeography.net has a large glossary filled with definitions of the major geographic terms (as well as a plethora of minor terms). So what is the advantage of having a Physical Geography glossary? When preparing for Geography Bees or for studying AP Geography, references to geographical features may arise or geographical terms and it is always good to have a place of reference. Since Geographic terms are occasionally classified as “Scientific Terms” many school dictionaries do not have their definitions within them. Dictionary.com has always been useful for looking of Physical Geographic terms, but what if you’re on the other end. By other end, I’m referring to if you don’t know the word you are looking for or you want to study all the words (if you are preparing for a competition that involves geography), then a glossary devoted to geographic terms would be more useful than Dictionary.com. You may contest that about.com has an excellent source of geographic terms. This is true, but the glossary of terms on about.com doesn’t come nearly as close to the glossary that is provided here.           Screenshot of the Page     You can check out the website here.

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 4 &#8211; Classes",
        "excerpt":" As you probably heard on the news this morning, there is a new Objective-C tutorial out. And it’s right here. How cool is that? Last time, we discussed if else statements and basic loops. This time, we’re going to master the art of the class. So what is a class? A class is basically a classification and framework for an object. Objects that are members of a class inherit variables and methods that are declared in the class. To put this into a real life example, you would be an object of the class “Human”. You might inherit variables such as height, gender, age, and weight. Some methods that you might inherit include tying your shoe and walking. Get it yet? Don’t worry if you don’t. That’s what this tutorial is for. Let’s make a class “aliens” (and, in the next tutorial, an object “Bill”).   Interface The first part of a class is the interface. In the interface, we name the variables and  methods of the class. When making a program that adheres to proper Objective-C practices, the interface goes in the header file ( .h ) and is imported into the main ( .m ) file. For the purpose of this tutorial, however, we are going to ignorantly put it in the main ( .m ) file. That’s pretty important to know. Our class is going to be “Alien”. The variables that we want members of the alien class to have include: number of eyes, age, and number of ears. Methods that members of the alien class are going to inherit will include: setNumberOfEyes, setAge, setNumberOfEars, and output. All of the “set” methods will be used in our program to set the value of the variables. Enough explaining for now, lets look over the code of an interface. Since we are coding only in the main file for now, the interface section will go right under the “#import” line(s).             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) output;            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        @interface Alien : NSObject { We declare the interface of a class with “@interface” followed by the class name (in this case “Alien”), a colon, and the super class (you really don’t need to know about them yet, don’t worry about it; just use NSObject for your programs until a later date on which I will explain them). The opening curly bracket opens the section of the interface where we will give the variables of the class. int NumberOfEyes; int Age; int NumberOfEars; } This is where we declare the variables that members of our class will inherit. If we create an object that is a member of the class “Alien”, then it will have the variables NumberOfEyes, Age, and NumberOfEars. The closing curly bracket closes the part of the interface where we declare the variables. -(void) output; -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i; -(void) setAge: (int) a; -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e; These are the declarations of the methods for our class. The actual methods will be in the implementation section (which we will go over next). Let’s go over how we declare a method. First, we have a dash followed by what the method will be returning (the “return value”). By returning, I mean that when we call a method in our program, do we want to get  any information back from the method to use in our program, or do we just want the code in our method to run. If we don’t want to return anything, we put “void”. If we wanted to return an integer value, we would put “-(int)”. Next, we name out method. In the method “-(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;”, setNumberOfEyes is the name of the method. This will be what we use to call on the method in our program. For methods that don’t need any information (they just run a bit of code when called upon), we would be done now (as is the case of the output method). For other methods, like setNumberOfEyes, we need to declare what type of information we are passing into it as well as the name of the variable that will be equal to the value that we pass into it. In the code of our methods, we can use that variable. If you don’t quite understand what I’m saying, just keep following along and you will get it at some point. @end We use @end to end our interface section. Bam. We’re done with the interface. That wasn’t so bad, was it?   Implementation The second part of a class is the implementation section. In it, we give the methods that we declared in the interface some body. That is, each of the methods that we declared in the interface has to have some code to run when they are called upon, and we write that code in the implementation section. You savvy? Here’s what the implementation section of our program is going to look like:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) output;            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            @end            @implementation Alien            -(void) output {            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars);            }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }            -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        @implementation Alien We declare the implementation section with a simple @implementation followed by the name of the class that the implementation corresponds to. -(void) output { NSLog(@”The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.”, Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars); } -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i { NumberOfEyes = i; } -(void) setAge: (int) a { Age = a; } -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e { NumberOfEars = e; } These are the bodies of our methods. In order to tell the computer which lines of code correspond to which methods in the interface, we copy the interface method declaration (minus the semicolon) from the interface and paste it in the implementation section. Then, we surround the code of each method with curly brackets (as shown the code above). As I mentioned in the explanation of the interface, methods that require information to be passed into them have a colon after the method name followed by the data type and the name of the variable that will be equal to the information we are passing into the method. We can then use that variable in the code of each method. For example, the “setNumberOfEyes” method requires that an integer value be passed into it. The variable “i” will be set equal to the value that is passed into the method. In the code of our method, we set the variable “NumberOfEyes” (as declared in our @interface) equal to the variable “i”, thus setting “NumberOfEyes” equal to the integer value that is passed into the method. You might ask why we are taking the long way around setting the alue of the variables that were declared in the interface section. Well, those variables are “protected” as it were, and can only be accessed by the methods of the same class. @end Just like the interface, we end our implementation section with a “@end”. In our next tutorial, we will go over making objects that are members of our class. ","categories": ["Objective-C"],

        "title": "Mac OS 10.7 Lion Released",
        "excerpt":" Apple announced Mac OS 10.7 Lion at the World Wide Developer Conference this June. You can read all about the features it brings to the Mac Operating System in our post about the WWDC. I realize that you probably don’t feel like clicking back there, so let’s review the main features.   Multi-Touch Gestures: Many applications and user interface elements in Lion make heavy use of finger gestures tracked by the trackpads on Apple’s latest notebook computers or by a separate touch-sensitive trackpad accessory. On such user element that has a major multi-touch gesture makeover is scrolling. No longer will you see scroll bars on Lion. Instead, you can use a finger scrolling gesture to move through the contents of a list or page within an application.  Full Screen Apps: There is now a simple, standard method for developers to make their applications compatible with a full-screen interface. In addition, the user interface for windows has been updated with a button in the top right corner for making an application full-screen or windowed. This is cool enough in itself, but now you can also use multi-touch gestures to switch between application screens, your desktop, and your dashboard.  Mission Control: With a simple gesture, you can now get an overlook at all of your open windows and applications. This is basically a combination of Spaces and Expose with some more eye candy and minor features. Plus, there is now a space for your dashboard.  Mac App Store Updates: Developers can take advantage of in-app purchases, push notifications, and sandboxing. Users will be able to enjoy speedy delta updates.  Launchpad: Launchpad ports over a major user interface feature from iOS. Namely, with a simple multi-touch gesture you can view all of the applications on your computer (simliar to the pages and pages of applications in iOS). These applications can be spread across multiple pages, and can be organized into folders.  Resume: When you open an application, Lion remembers where you were before you last quit it and it displays the corresponding windows, open files, settings, etc.  Auto Save: Lion automatically save all of your work as you edit it. Plus, the menu of document now has a list of options relating to this auto saving feature. You can view all of the saved versions of document, lock the document to prevent further writing, duplicate the document, and revert to the last opened version of the document.  Versions: Versions utilizes the auto saving feature in Lion. New versions of your documents are automatically saved as you edit them, you can take manual version saves, the saves are efficiently stored (with only the changes between versions actually being saved), and only the current version of a document being shared when a document is shared with other people. As mentioned in the description about auto saving, there is an option in the document title menu that allows you to view all versions of a document in a Time Machine type interface.  AirDrop: AirDrop is a Peer-to-Peer file sharing network that runs over a Wi-Fi network. In finder, there is an option for AirDrop. In this section, you can see all of the other Lion computers on the network and sharing files with other users is as easy as drag n’ drop. For added security, users need to confirm actions when sending and receiving files (though really you shouldn’t even use a Wi-Fi network where there might be users with malicious intent). All files are fully encrypted as they are sent.  Mail Update: The mail application that comes with all Macintosh computers has been updated with iOS-like user interface. This interface includes a left-hand side email list and a conversation view.In addition, there is a favorites bar where you can keep folder buttons. Lastly, the search bar now sports suggestions.Don’t think that that is it, though. Apple claims that there are over 250 new features waiting to be discovered! Let’s talk about whether Lion is a step in the right direction or not. To quote Apple, Mac OS X Lion is “The power of Mac OS X. The magic of the iPad.” Does adding all of these elements of iOS oversimplify the OS? I think so. A functional desktop operating system simply needs to have an obvious file system, as well as freedom to organize and save files and applications as you wish (The one exception to this (that I rather like about Lion) is Launchpad). Without sophistication, without high level features that take some knowledge to be able to use, you lose a lot of OS capability. The heavy incorporation of multi-touch gestures into the OS will be both a plus and a minus. They will make it easier and faster to perform certain operations that would otherwise take a couple clicks. A downside of using a trackpad to control your Mac will be the difficulty of using some applications such as games. Only having a trackpad will render some games useless. Before you rush to install Lion onto your computer, you may want to consider some things. The biggest drawback to Lion is the lack of backwards compatibility. That is, a lot of applications built for previous versions of the Mac operating system will just not work. A well known suite of Applications that isn’t supported by Lion is Microsoft Office. As has been true with past Mac updates, most widely used applications will recieve updates in the several months following the release of this new version of the operating system. For another thing, a few built-in applications have been dropped, such as Front Row. While you can easily substitute Front Row with programs like Boxee or Plex, Front Row will be missed by many Mac users. The last thing to consider is whether or not you actually like the new user interface of Lion. Many, including myself, dislike the over-simplicity that comes from the “magic of the iPad”. For developers, Lion means not only having to update all of their old applications, but also having access to 3,000 new APIs. These APIs will let enable developers to take advantage of new operating system features like multi-touch gestures, full screen applications, in-app purchases, push notifications, resume, auto save, versions, AV foundation (developers can use this to “play, examine and compose audiovisual media” into their apps), aqua (popovers and overlay scrollbars), and iCloud. For you non-developers, this means that you can expect these features in new Mac applications. Registered Apple developers had the opportunity to upgrade their computers to Lion way back in June. Since then, many bug fixes and tweaks have been applied to the OS. You shouldn’t run into any problems with your installation of Lion. Of course, many things are rarely as they should be. If you look over the many reviews on the Mac OS X Lion page of the Mac App Store, you will see that many people are having issues. My favorite review title regarding this is “So many problems it feels like Windows”. If you are convinced that Mac OS Lion is right for you, then there are a few things that you should do before upgrading. For one, you should make a backup of all of the files on your computer (if you haven’t already done so; you should backup your files on a monthly basis). For another thing, the Mac App Store can only be accessed on Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard. If your computer isn’t already running Snow Leopard, then upgrade now. Lastly, make sure you have at least 4 GB of free space on your computer as Lion is 3.49 GB. Now that you’ve done all that, go ahead and install it! You can install Lion onto your Apple computer by heading on over to the Mac App Store and purchasing it for $29.99 (here’s the link). Over 1 million people have already downloaded it!

        "title": "9 Superb Web-Based Image Editors And Illustrators",
        "excerpt":"I’m sure we’ve all wanted to use image editing software at some point or another, and the two programs that come to mind are Photoshop and Gimp. While they are both phenomenal pieces of image editing software, they can sometimes prove inconvenient or (in the case of Photoshop) too expensive. You can easily overcome these issues by making use of a web app that has almost all the features you would want along with unique cloud storage capabilities. In this post, I want to share with you nine great web-based image editing applications that I have discovered in my quest to find a viable graphic creation and manipulation program.   1. Sumo Paint      I consider Sumo Paint to be the cream of the crop. Not only is it bursting with features, but it has a clean and intuitive interface. Sumo Paint comes loaded with all of the basic Photoshop tools, plus both 3D brushes and animated brushes. In addition, Sumo Paint allows for the editing of multiple images at once (you can even copy and paste between images).   Some of the more complex features that Sumo Paint has to offer (and that any great image editor has) are layers, filters, and layer effects. They allow you to efficiently create complicated illustrations, as well as drastically change the look of your graphics with the click of a (virtual) button.   I would recommend this application to talented graphic designers who want to be able to digitally illustrate on the go.   You can see what is possible with Sumo Paint by looking at user generated content at http://www.sumopaint.com/images/. And that brings up another nifty feature: the Sumo Paint community. If you register an account with Sumo Paint, you can not only save your projects to the cloud, but also share your creations with the community. In addition, you can check out what other users have been creating and &#8220;favorite&#8221; their graphics.   The only weak points of Sumo Paint (that I noticed) were some oddities with the way the text tool works (rasterization, editing), as well as the small amount of file formats supported (PNG, JPEG, GIF).   Check out Sumo Paint for yourself at http://www.sumopaint.com/.   2. Pixlr    Pixlr’s excellent user interface allows you to access some sophisticated image editing tools. That’s not to say it doesn’t provide the standard set of drawing and editing tools that make for a useful image editor (it does). Like Sumo Paint, Pixlr has layer support, layer effects, and a ton of filters. Exporting your finished product from Pixlr is quite easy, and (in addition to saving to your computer) there is the option to publish your creation to any popular social network, as well as a simple image hosting site (imm.io). As a bonus, Pixlr provides web developers with an API for hooking the editor into their website. If you aren’t that geeky, you can just embed the editor into your website or blog with an HTML snippet (it uses iframes). Make the next Mona Lisa at http://pixlr.com/ . Oh, and while you’re visiting their site, you should also check out their other image editing web-apps. They’re pretty cool!   3. Splashup     Splashup has a user interface very similar to that of Pixlr. It has all of the basic drawing and editing tools of an image editing application, along with a few simple filters. The most advanced feature is layer support (which it handles very neatly and understandably).   I would recommend Splashup to people who want to perform some moderate adjustments to their photos, or to those who want to draw a simple graphic.   You can import images from your computer, a social network, or a URL. When exporting your image, you can either save to your computer (as a JPG, FXO, or PNG), or share it on several popular social networks.   Make your dog look like a superhero or work with some basic filters at http://www.splashup.com/.   4. Phoenix    Made by the folks over at Aviary, Phoenix allows for simple to moderate image editing and illustrating. In it, you can make use of a variety of tools and filters. There is also great support for layering.   At first glance, it seems like Phoenix is only equipped with a few simple tools. After further investigation, you will find that most of these tools has sub-tools, and each is packed with options that allow for a wide variety of editing and illustrating. In addition to good tools, Phoenix has a sophisticated layer system. It has all of the layer management options that Photoshop has. Unique to Phoenix, there are four types of layers that I have yet to figure out.   If you make a mistake in Phoenix, it&#8217;s no biggy. There is a history window that makes it easy to revert your image to the condition it was in after previous edits.   If have images that were created in Photoshop and you want to work with them in Phoenix, there is an option in the &#8220;File&#8221; menu to import a PSD file. When saving/exporting your image, you can either save the whole project to an Aviary account (you have to make one to use this feature), or export the image as a PNG, GIF, JPG, TIFF, or PSD (for editing in photoshop).   Apply some complex effects to your images at http://www.aviary.com/tools/image-editor.   5. Picnik    Picnik is ideal for applying a variety of effects to your photos, as well as performing simple edits. Both free and premium plans are offered, but unless you are a hard-core photographer that frequently edits images (and wants to do so efficiently) you won’t need a premium account. With both plans, you can come up with some pretty cool results in a matter of minutes. Enhance your photos and turn them into masterpieces at http://www.picnik.com/.   6. Photoshop.com    It doesn’t nearly match the capabilities of Photoshop, but Photoshop.com sports an interesting combination of a simple image editing web-app and a (mini) social network. You can upload pictures from your computer, or choose on from your library (which you will have when you make an account). As you can probably see in the (outdated) screenshot, available tools include cropping, rotating, saturation, burn, dodge, sharpen, soft focus, distort, hue, and more. Some of them  are controlled by a convenient slider (that I rather like). Make your photos look incredible at http://www.photoshop.com/ (I bet you didn’t see that coming).   7. FotoFlexer      Fotoflexer&#8217;s interface isn&#8217;t the best, but at least it&#8217;s intuitive. In each tab (pictured above)  you are offered many tools, filters, stickers, animations, etc.  The most notable tools are the effects and the decorations. There are a TON of effects to choose from, each with some sort of configuration. The decorations let you put your face in a funny or interesting image, place your image on a poster (and caption it), or place a border/frame around your image.   If you want to work with multiple graphics on the same image, there is very basic layer support.   You can import images from your computer, a URL, or one of several social networks. You can save your final image to your computer, Fotoflexer (you need an account), a social network, an email (it will send you the picture as an attachment), a Fotoflexer hosted URL,  or to TinyPic.   Fiddle around with cool photo effects at http://fotoflexer.com/.   8. Lunapic    Lunapic boasts an almost overwhelming amount of effects and animations, plus most of the basic image editing tools. That’s really what it is all about. The only thing that the developers at Lunapic should work on is the user interface. The strongest ability of Lunapic is that of making great animated GIFs using the many animation effects (the most notable being, in my opinion, transitions and water/reflection). They have also developed a few project templates like the Extended Facebook Pic. Make some snazzy animations at http://www.lunapic.com/editor/.   9. Pixer.us  Pixer.us provides you with a handful of features that make editing your photos quick and easy. The user interface is very simple and straightforward. In addition to the basic image editing tools, there are some cool “specialfx” effects that can be applied to your image. Images are uploaded and imported via a basic javascript uploader. Do some simple editing of your images at http://pixer.us/. ","categories": ["Awesome Websites"],

        "title": "SimpleNote Lets You Take Simple Notes Anywhere",
        "excerpt":"   A friend recently shared another marvelous service with me that I thought you might enjoy. This service, SimpleNote, does what the name suggests. It allows you to take simple notes. While there are many services and applications that let you take notes, not all of them are available on a wide variety of platforms (as well as the web). Although they only have official clients for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, there are 32 3rd party applications/extensions that use SimpleNote’s service. Perhaps the best feature that SimpleNote has to offer is syncing throughout all of your devices. If you make a note on your iPhone, it will be synced to your iPad and computer. How cool is that? The user interface on all official SimpleNote clients is very simple and elegant. On iOS, the font and light colored theme are a big step up from the standard note app.    Some other noteworthy features that are unique to this service are being able to share notes with other users, publish notes to web pages, add tags to notes, and look back at note history. In order to share your note with another user of SimpleNote, you simply add their email address to the tag field. The user that you share with will be able to edit the note that you share with them and it will be synced between all of your devices as well as their devices (one good way to make use of this is sharing a grocery list with your spouse). You can also publish your notes to web pages. Doing so will provide you with a link to a page on the simple-note.appspot.com website that contains your note. The page will be updated as you update your note.  Tags can be added to each of your notes. This will allow you to search for notes by tag (instead of keyword). The last noteworthy feature is note history. After each revision of a note, a copy is saved in the note’s history. Not only can you look back at the history of a note, but you can revert a note to an earlier version. The only low points of SimpleNote that I noticed were the (unobtrusive) ads. Of course, they’re perfectly understandable seeing as how SimpleNote is free. All in all, I think that SimpleNote is definitely worth a try. Check it out on the web at http://simplenoteapp.com/. If you have a device running iOS, then you can download the mobile app at http://itunes.apple.com/app/simplenote/id289429962 . Enjoy! ","categories": ["App Review","Awesome Websites","Review"],

        "title": "Mozilla Is Working On An Open Mobile OS Called &#8220;Boot to Gecko&#8221;",
        "excerpt":" Mozilla, the company behind the popular web browser “Firefox“, is working on a new project. Following in the footsteps of Google’s development of Chrome OS, Mozilla intends to build a mobile operating system. This OS will have a focus on running web applications, and is to be built upon the open-source Gecko HTML layout engine. The Gecko engine was developed by Mozilla itself, and is used in numerous applications such as Mozilla’s Firefox. A developer over at Mozilla says that the goal of Boot to Gecko is the build a complete, standalone operating system for the open web. Unsurprisingly, this is a pretty good description of Chrome OS. While this kind of OS sounds great in theory, it has been shown to be a flop. Although it could just be poor implementation, Chrome OS isn’t all that great, and it certainly didn’t take off. Mozilla’s expertise in the field of web applications almost matches Google’s (okay, maybe not really, but they certainly are in the know), and their years of experience may allow them to create a successful open-source web-based mobile OS. Boot to Gecko will use some of the core elements of Google’s Android OS. Namely, the boot drivers and the kernel. Chrome OS, on the other hand, is a Linux-based operating system. It is interesting that Google already had their own mobile OS to use as a base for their  web-based OS, but chose an alternative instead. Unlike Google, Mozilla doesn’t yet have their own mobile OS to play with. They were left to choose another company’s project. Both Google and Mozilla chose to use the core features of a pre-made OS. Developers working on the project promise to release the source code of the OS in real time via their Github project page here. This adhere’s the the organization’s general code of conduct (almost all of their projects are open-source, including Firefox). Similarly to Mozilla, Google made a developer build of Chrome (Chromium) open source, and their Android OS used to be available source. However, both of Google’s operating systems fail to be completely open source, making it more difficult for manufacturers and consumers alike to gain access to the operating systems (and put them on their own devices). Mozilla’s openness is sure to give Boot to Gecko some extra popularity. Boot to Gecko will get it’s functionality from web-apps (as is the basis of any web-based operating system). As you probably know, static web pages are fairly useless for doing things like making phone calls, texting people, taking pictures, playing sophisticated games, and other highly interactive and useful tasks. The developers of Boot to Gecko want web pages to be able to access the computer/phone’s functionality, and provide an interface for taking advantage of it. Without old, cpu-intensive plugins like Java and Adobe Flash. As a result, web-applications built for Boot to Gecko will be able to run on any device. Of course, applications that make use of Boot to Gecko’s API (that enables web developers to make web-apps that can access the functionality of devices running Boot to Gecko) will not be able to function properly on non-Boot to Gecko devices. What’s your take on Boot to Gecko? Do you think it’s going to be a success or a failure? Share your opinion by leaving a comment! ","categories": ["Hot News","Operating System"],

        "excerpt":"   Google and OK Go have been working together to produce an awesome music video in the form of a Chrome experiment. Google needs no introduction, but if you are one of the few that doesn’t watch many videos on YouTube, then you may not be familiar with OK Go’s work. They are a rock band that  makes rather incredible videos (that ALL go viral). You can find their videos on their channel (here). The video itself consists of multiple windows the move around, overlap, and resize. Each window plays a video, and the overall effect is, well, awesome. The video is also interactive. Before is starts, you are prompted to give a short message. This message is used near the end of the video. The people wearing blue suits create letters with their feet that spell out your message. That must have taken an incredible amount of programming! With a heavy focus on HTML 5 and Javascript, the project shows what impressive things are possible with this new age of web development.    In order to experience the music video for yourself, point your Chrome browser to  http://www.allisnotlo.st/. You should stop any other programs you have running, as it is resource intensive. If you don’t think you’re computer can handle it, or if you are too lazy to go through all that (it shouldn’t be all that tough… you are already using Chrome, right?) then you can watch the lame-o version below:    If you thought that was cool, then you should check out some of the other 269 (as of now) Chrome experiments at http://www.chromeexperiments.com/.

        "title": "PHP Tutorial 1 &#8211; About PHP &#038; Installing MAMP And XAMPP",
        "excerpt":" PHP is one of the most useful and powerful scripting languages in web development. Facebook was mostly coded using PHP (along with the help of database management system Mysql). You can create an entire search engine for a website using PHP. The possibilities are endless. But the main reasons that PHP is so great is that it is easy to use and it allows for rapidly changing web pages. One can even just incorporate a little bit of PHP into their HTML document and voila! PHP all done!   What is PHP? PHP stands for “PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor”. It was first designed by Rasmus Lerdorf back in 1994 with the goal of recording website traffic and displaying his résumé. Since then, a number of developers have stepped in and further developed the language. PHP is used for server-side scripting. That is, PHP code is interpreted, run, and compiled by the server it is on. Scripting and markup languages such as Javascript and HTML, on the other hand, are executed by a browser. Understand the difference? Good. When PHP code is compiled and run, it results in HTML. This HTML is then sent to the browser that is requesting a web page. PHP is extremely useful for creating dynamic web pages. The content of these pages can constantly change depending on what information the PHP code is given. This is done by means of variables and functions (which you should be familiar with if you have worked with almost any programming language). Enough of my blabbering, let’s set up our PHP environments and start coding!   Installing A Server Environment   Most computers don&#8217;t come with PHP installed. An exception is Macintosh, but you&#8217;ll still want to install a complete server environment even if you are on a Mac.   Server environment installers and managers install all the necessary libraries and programs necessary to run PHP, Mysql, Apache, and more (depending on which server environment you go with). There are a large number of these environment packages available, and it can seem a little overwhelming. Allow me to break it down for you and instruct you on how to choose and install them.             Environment &amp; What It Stands For/What It Offers                  Operating System(s) It Can Run On                  How To Install                    MAMP &#8211; Mac Apache Mysql PHP                  Mac                   Head on over to http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html and hit the big download link at the top of the page. This will download a zip file containing the software installer packages for the MAMP software. Run the package to install MAMP. Done.                    WAMP &#8211; Windows, Apache, Mysql, PHP                  Windows                   Go to http://www.wampserver.com/en/download.php and click the corresponding download link. Simply run the executable to install.                    LAMP &#8211; Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP                  Linux                  LAMP doesn&#8217;t come in a nice bundle of software, you have to install each element separately. Due to this, I&#8217;m just going to refer you to this helpful tutorial: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies                    XAMPP                  Mac, Windows, Linux, Solaris                   Click on over to http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html and select your operating system from the list. After you download the file from the page that you are sent to, follow the detailed instructions on the download page to install.        For the purposes of this series of tutorials, I suggest you use MAMP if you are on a Mac, and XAMPP if you are on Windows or Linux. If MAMP doesn’t work for you for some reason, try XAMPP. If XAMPP on Windows doesn’t work for you, try WAMP. Now let’s make sure we’ve got our environment set up correctly (and go over starting all the necessary servers). Each has a slightly different start procedure, so I’m going to go through them separately.   MAMP   There are two ways to start up the MAMP server. The first is using the MAMP app that comes bundled with the MAMP software. Navigate to the MAMP folder that you installed to your Applications folder. The MAMP application is in this folder. Upon opening it, a small control window will pop up. If the server statuses don&#8217;t switch to the on position automatically, click the &#8220;start servers&#8221; button. Next, click the &#8220;preferences&#8230;&#8221; button, and, in the &#8220;ports&#8221; tab, click &#8220;set to default Apache and MySQL ports&#8221; button.      An alternative way (that I prefer) is using the dashboard widget. Unfortunately, the only way to get it is to download the old version of MAMP (the link can be found at the bottom of the MAMP download page). It&#8217;s in the MAMP folder that is in the disk image (MAmp Control.wdgt). Once the widget is installed (double-click it), all you have to do is click the start button on the widget when viewing your dashboard.   Once all of the lights are green and everything is running, go to http://localhost/MAMP/ . You should see the &#8220;Welcome to MAMP&#8221; screen.   XAMPP  On Macintosh, starting your server is as easy as opening the “XAMPP Control” application that is in the XAMPP folder. If you installed it as described in the instructions, the XAMPP folder is in your Applications folder. Upon opening it, a small control window will open. Start Apache. If all is well, you should see the XAMPP splash screen when you go to http://localhost . On Windows, you can access the XAMPP control panel by clicking on the “XAMPP Control Panel” shortcut that was made on your desktop during the installation. Start “Apache”, and navigate to http://localhost . You should see the XAMPP splash screen.  On Linux, starting XAMPP is as easy as running the command “/opt/lampp/lampp start”. Point your browser to http://localhost and you should see the XAMPP splash screen. I hope you found this tutorial helpful! In our next tutorial, we are going to go over where to put our PHP files, what we should use to edit them, and a how to write basic program in PHP. ","categories": ["PHP"],

        "title": "PHP Tutorial 2 &#8211; Creating Your First Web Page Using PHP (Hello World)",
        "excerpt":" Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to PHP tutorial 2! In our last tutorial, we covered setting up your server environment. In this tutorial, we are going to go over creating your first web page using PHP. With all standard server environments, there is a folder called “htdocs” where you put the actual files that make up your website. This is where you put your PHP files. For MAMP, this folder will be in the MAMP folder that you put in your Applications folder earlier. For Mac users of XAMPP, this folder will be in the XAMPP folder that is in your Applications folder. For Windows users of MAMP, this will be in the XAMPP folder on your hard drive. For Linux users of XAMPP, this folder will be in your XAMPP folder. Found the htdocs folder? Good. If you open the htdocs folder, you should see an “index.php” file (among others).  This is the default file that is run when a user goes to your URL (think of it as the home page). The server runs the PHP code in it, and the browser renders the HTML that the server sends it (as output of the PHP code). Before we start editing it, we will need a PHP editor. We’re not going to be working on a ny major projects any time soon, so a simple, free one will suite the purpose just fine. For If you are on a Mac, I suggest you download a neat application called Komodo Edit (http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit). This program is also available for Windows, but Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)is also a great option. Now that you have an editor, let’s start coding. First, open the index.php file that is in the htdocs folder (on Macintosh, you can right click index.php, choose “open with”, and  navigate to your editor; on Windows, you can go to File -&gt; Open in your editor and choose index.php). Next, replace all the code that you see with the following:             &lt;html&gt;            &lt;head&gt;            &lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;            &lt;/head&gt;            &lt;body&gt;            &lt;?php            echo \"Hello World!\";            ?&gt;            &lt;/body&gt;            &lt;/html&gt;      To view the result, save the PHP document, start your Apache server, and go to http://localhost . You should already understand the HTML, and we won’t be going over that. You should, however, take note that a PHP document is really a HTML document with special code. What you probably aren’t familiar with is the chunk of code that starts with “”. This is the PHP code. When working with PHP, you have to enclose the code with the tags “” (for closing the section). As for the ” echo ‘Hello World!’; “, this will output “Hello World!” to the HTML document. “Echo” is a language construct that behaves like a function. It is used to output strings of text to the HTML document. The text that you want outputted must be in parenthesis, although it will work with both single and double parenthesis. You may want to use one or the other based on what you are outputting. For example, if I wanted to output double quotations, I would want to use single quotations (otherwise the computer would get confused and think I were ending my string of text in the middle of it). And that is your standard “Hello World!” in PHP! ","categories": ["PHP"],

        "title": "Split iPod Audio Among Multiple Headphones With the Belkin Rockstar",
        "excerpt":" I bumped into this nifty gadget while looking for some iPod accessories. The Belkin Rockstar lets you easily split the audio out from an iPod, MP3 player, DVD player, or other portable media device. What makes this splitter unique is that up to 5 different headphones can connect to it (customary audio splitters only split two ways). Not only that, but you can connect multiple audio outputting devices at once. Of course, if you play audio from multiple devices at the same time, the audio will be blended.  I don’t think that there has ever been a time when I’ve wanted to share my iPod audio with five of my friends, but if that sounds like something you would do, this is probably for you. I can see this being useful if you have a portable DVD player and you are on a long car ride with multiple people, or if you have several speakers you wan to connect your iPod to. Of course, it will probably be useless in these scenarios if you don’t have a couple headphones handy. The going price is $14.99 if you buy it from their website, but you can also buy it from Amazon for $27.95 (new) or $6.59 (used). That’s not too overly priced, especially when you consider that most two-way splitters go for around $7. This includes the audio splitter itself, one integrated green audio cable, and one detachable cable. ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets"],

The film was the second project in Dentsu’s “Making Future Magic” series in which they wanted to be “exploratory with media, wonder what magical visions of the future might look like, and try and create communications of cultural value”. This is obviously not your average stop-motion animation. It is made up of floating light animations and words. This isn’t all that impressive on its own, as you can make such animations and graphics in Photoshop and After Effects. Their strategy of animation and painting was very creative and unique. They made long exposure recordings of an iPad moving through space as it displayed layers of a 3D model. The process starts by making 3D models in modeling and animation software. Then, cross sections of the models are taken and organized into a video. The video is played back on an iPad (or iPads) while people move them smoothly through the air. Meanwhile, A camera is set to take a long exposure (3-6 second) photograph of the moving iPads.  If you are interested in making light paintings of your own, you can buy an app made by Dentsu called “Penki” (Japanese for “paint”). It only costs 99 cents, but you will need a camera that has an exposure length setting. ","categories": ["App Review","Video"],

        "title": "4.3 Update To The Apple TV: Vimeo &#038; TV Show Buying and Streaming",
        "excerpt":"   Apple just released an update to the Apple TV software. Increasing the software version to 4.3, the update brings two main features. As pictured in the update screen above, users of the second generation of Apple TVs can now purchase and play TV shows from iTunes. In addition, the entire database of videos on Vimeo can be easily accessed via the “internet” tab. For those not familiar with the device, the Apple TV is a small, $99 box made by Apple that, when connected by HDMI to a compatible television, allows users to rent and purchase content from iTunes, as well as view media from internet sources (such as Netflix and Vimeo). It is also capable of displaying/playing images and audio from your computer. For more information, you can check out Apple’s website.  To quote Apple’s Apple TV update and documentation page:   TV show purchases: Purchase TV shows on Apple TV. Shows purchased on Apple TV can be re-downloaded on other iOS devices. Shows purchased on other iOS devices or with iTunes automatically show up as available to play on Apple TV. In the past, the only way to view premium content on the Apple TV was to rent a movie or TV show. Now, you can purchase and play TV shows and Movies right from the Apple TV. Plus, you can view your iTunes purchase history and play movies that you have bought on other devices. All content is streamed from Apple servers, since there is only a small amount of built-in storage. This could easily save the Apple TV from it’s current unpopularity, as the biggest downside to the Apple TV was a limited content library (due to difficult licensing deals for rentals).    The Apple TV update page describes the new feature as follows:   Vimeo: Browse and watch millions of user-uploaded videos found on the Vimeo service, for free. Prior to the addition of Vimeo, the only internet services that could be accessed from the Apple TV were Flickr and YouTube. They are both great services, but the more media the better. With Vimeo, Apple TV owners will now have many more millions of videos to watch. You’ve probably heard of Vimeo if you are a watcher of many videos on the internet. In case you aren’t all that familiar with the service, it is a video sharing service (like YouTube) that has a high standard on quality. It encourages users to upload creative, HD videos made by themselves. Technorati: YFA66QT2SBVN ","categories": ["Apple","Hot News","Operating System","Video"],

        "title": "iCloud.com Beta Launched (For Developers)",
        "excerpt":" Back in April, Apple bought the domain icloud.com from the Swedish company that created CloudMe. Then, in June, Apple went on to announce the service “iCloud“. Today, Apple launched the iCloud beta web app suite. For more information regarding the iCloud services as a whole, refer to our WWDC announcement post. iCloud is the successor of Mobile Me, Apple’s first attempt at a collection of online services that helped users sync their information between devices and access it on the web. It really wasn’t that great, even Steve Jobs admitted it was a flop. So far, iCloud seems bigger, better, and cheaper then Mobile Me. I’m guessing that it will be quite popular. The iCloud web apps currently include Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Find My iPhone, and iWork. The first four are pretty straight-forward and almost identical to their corresponding iOS maps, but iWork needs a little bit of explanation. It will serve as a web interface for viewing documents (in your iCloud storage) created in Keynote, Pages, and Numbers.        The user interface greatly emulates that of iOS devices, with big eye-candy icons and blue alert windows. All of the web apps also are very similar to their iOS app counterparts. The iCloud services are currently only available to developers, and require that you have OS X Lion 10.7.2 developer beta or iOS 5 (developer only). iCloud will probably be released to the public sometime this fall. Information regarding the pricing of iCloud were also released today. All iCloud users will get 5GB of storage for free, and all media purchased though iTunes that is stored on iCloud will not count against that 5GB. If you want another 10GB, it will cost you $20 per year. 20GB extra will be $40 per year. If you want to have an additional 50GB, it will cost you $100 per year. To summarize:             5 GB                  Free                    15 GB                  $20/year                    25 GB                  $40/year                    50 GB                  $100/year        The prices aren’t too bad if you don’t plan on storing that many files, but if you want to store large files on the cloud you should look elsewhere. What do you think about iCloud? Are you going to be using it? We want to hear from you in the comments! ","categories": ["Apple","Hot News"],

        "title": "Hide Desktop Clutter on Your Mac With Camouflage",
        "excerpt":"   I’m an unorganized slob. My desktop is littered with over 200 folders, images, files, and applications. Just as I was about to lose all hope towards having a desktop that at least appeared clean, I bumped into Camouflage. Camouflage is a small, effective, and quick Mac application that lets you easily hide all of the icons on your desktop. It’s small control button resides in your toolbar, and all you need to do to hide the clutter on your desktop is click the button and select “Hide Icons”. Some great customizable aspects include setting a custom wallpaper to appear when hiding icons, and setting a folder that you want to open when you double-click the icon-free desktop. By default, the camouflage wallpaper is your normal wallpaper, and the Desktop folder will open when you double-click the clean desktop. To navigate to these preferences, you need only to click the toolbar icon and select “Preferences…”. If you find yourself using Camouflage frequently, you can set a hot key for easy on-off toggling. You can download this nifty utility from the developer’s website for free, or from the Mac App Store for $1.99. The free version is actually the older version, but it runs fine on Mac OS 10.4 – 10.6. Although it runs on Lion, it will render Mission Control unusable while Camouflage is running. The new paid version fixes this issue (and you will be supporting a hard working developer).

        "title": "P versus NP &#8211; Destruction of the Internet",
        "excerpt":"You are going to look at me like I’m crazy, but hypothetically one could destroy the internet. All one would have to do was solve the P versus NP problem (which is borderline paradoxical) a certain way and you could bypass any single security on the internet. How does one solve P versus NP? First we need to understand exactly what an algorithm is. If you know, then you can skip my next stupid question. If you don’t, then check it out. Algorithms An algorithm is a confined process of completing a mathematical or non-mathematical problem. Some conditions of the algorithm is that it cannot have any errors or be too arbitrary when completed properly. Ex) The Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the Greatest Common Factor of 2 numbers.   The numbers are 455 and 900  Subtract the smaller integer from the larger one  900-455 = 445  You now have the two numbers of 455 and 445  Then subtract 445 from 455  The answer is 10.  Take 445 and subtract 10 from it  Your answer is 435  Take 435 and continuously subtract 10 from it until you get a number lower than 10.  That number will be 5.  Subtract 5 from 10. You’ll get 5.  If you subtract 5 from 5, you’ll get 0.  This means 5 is the greatest common factor of 455 and 900.  Check it out yourself.That is how an algorithm would work. Time Complexity Programming’s most jumbled aspect is the Time Complexity. How fast can a program go in its worst case scenario? How about its best case scenario? How about average? This is all very convoluted. What you need to know is that Time isn’t counted 1 second, 2 second… It is counted just using numbers. No units. So what are the 2 times used in P versus NP? Polynomial and Non-Deterministic. **Polynomial Time – Fast and Easy ** Let’s say I write a program that adds 2 numbers together. We know that the maximum amount of numbers that can be added in this situation is. So this makes the time at which the program travels at, x^2. 2 is the constant of the equation and x is the number of pieces of data being used. If we want to add 3 numbers together, the equation becomes 3^2 = 9. Small amount of time, huh? Even if we want to add 100 numbers together, we’ll still only get 10,000, which is less than a second’s work for a computer. Needless to say, Polynomial Time is the fastest type of time the computer could use. ** Non-Deterministic Polynomial Time – Slow to Do, Fast to check ** This is what NP stands for. An example of this time is the Subset Problem. Let’s take a subset of 5 numbers {5, -1, 1, 4, -4}. In this problem, we wish to know whether or not the sum of some of the integers equals 0. The obvious answer is yes. (-4) + (4) = 0 would be the stupidly simple answer. But for a computer, the computer has to check each answer by taking the 5, adding it to -1…So on and so forth. The factorial of this subset is 120, so the computer has to check the subset 120 times. But how does the computer check? It just adds the numbers up, to see whether or not it equals 0. If the numbers equal 0, then the process to determine if it is equal to 0 is called a witness. WAIT! The process of adding the numbers to create the witness! It is in Polynomial Time! This makes another theorem proven correct. All problems in NP (that answer to be yes)  has to have  been checked using P. If a problem in NP answers to be no, then it doesn’t have to be checked using P. P versus NP So what is P versus NP? It is a question theorized by Stephen Cook in 1971. P versus NP asks “can problems that are checked easily, be solved easily too?” Well we know problems in NP cannot be solved easily but can be checked easily. And we know that questions in P can be both solved and checked easily. This makes the simple answer “no.” No, P is always faster than NP, and NP is never equal to P. The problem is how do you prove your answer equals no? How do you prove that P will never be slower than NP? How do you prove computers cannot ever solve problems that are in NP faster than they can solve problems in P? If you can prove it, though, the Clay Mathematics Institute offers a prize of $1,000,000 to who ever proved it. Significance Now you are wondering how to destroy the internet. This is very hypothetical as most people believe P to be faster than NP. But what if P is slower than NP? This would be catastrophic: If I could write a program that uses NP to be faster than P, that is supposed to hack past firewalls, I could get into any account. See, accounts are nothing but number/letter combinations. But these combinations has a maximum different type of letters, and a maximum length of password. For example; The code for a billionaire’s bank account is a 11-digit code. Since there are 10 different possible numbers, this makes the permutation for the number of combinations is 11! or 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6… This would take the computer quite some time to figure out. But since NP is faster than P, one could compute this in the time it takes one to compute 2 +2 =4. This could be very disastrous to the world. And since the internet is just interconnected, this’ll be happening if NP is faster than P. But thankfully, most people accept P to be much faster than NP, and computers that can check their problems quickly, can not necessarily solve them quickly.   Sources: Mathematics by Richard Elwes www.wikipedia.org   ","categories": ["How To"],

        "title": "Ten Best iOS Games of 2011 (Jan. to Jul.)",
        "excerpt":"In the past couple of months, several very interesting new games came out that require the usage of puzzles and games that have very unique graphics. Here are ten games that intrigued me, but also excel in graphics, musical score, and storyline.   Superbrothers: Sword and Sorcery EP Developer: Capybara Games Inc. Price: $2.99 (iPod Touch and iPhone), $4.99 (iPad)** This game is just great. It has great, unique, graphics combined with a killer audio track. It has an excellent storyline and the interface is superb. This is one game that I liked all around. The engrossing story will keep you hooked on it for hours, maybe days.           You follow the path of a warrior monk and its errand             Amazing huh?     World of Goo Developer: 2D Boy Price: $2.99 (iPod, iPhone) and $4.99 (iPad + universal) **This game received MetaCritic’s highest rating of all time…98. So you can anticipate this game is going to be great. I like this game because it has a puzzle aspect to it, as well as unique graphics. 2 D graphics are some of the most popular on the App Store because they are less expensive to make, and you can make great games using them…Angry Birds, Cut the Rope, World of Goo…           Tower-Esque Building Game             Da Da Da-Da Da!!!   Gears Developer: Crescent Moon Games Price: $1.99** This game combines stellar graphics with a previously created idea. Games where you try and roll a ball around have been on the app store for about 2 years. But Gears surpasses them all because it has great graphics. These graphics were created using Unity3D, so that explains the awesomeness.           Aren't those graphics great?             \"Excellent,\" said Bill and Ted               Unity3D Graphics   Qvoid Developer: Raimon Zamora Chanza Price: $1.99 This puzzle game is based around a simple idea with colors, similar to that of Trainyard. The goal is to move a white cube around picking up all the colors on the grid so you can restore the grid to its original, black and white. This may seem to be prosaic/elementary but it can become quite challenging as you progress through the game.           Nice Graphics   Storm in a Teacup Developer: Chillingo Price: $2.99 A platformer, similar to that of **Little Big Planet, is one of the most interesting of its kind to come out on the App Store. You travel around your world in a teacup (sounds strange, huh?) trying to get past levels the same way one would do in Little Big Planet, minus the Sack guy. It is very good overall, but I don’t exactly like the fact it has very minimal story to it.           Interesting             I wasn't kidding about the Teacup     Rocket Bunnies Developer: Chillingo Ltd. Price: $2.99 (iPad), $0.99 (iPhone, iPod touch) WTF?? Rockets? Bunnies! Are you messing with me? These are some of the rhetorical questions I asked before I looked at the app. It seemed to have received good ratings, despite the incongruous title. And I have to agree with the reviewers. This app proved to be more fun than I expected it to be.           Rocket Bunnies   Bumpy Road Developer:  Simogo Handelsboag Price: $2.99 Another game I was skeptical of. But this time, my skepticism proved to agree with my actual feelings about the game. I didn’t exactly like the whole game play. It was just an idea I didn’t like. But since the game was widely congratulated, I felt I should include it as a game to check out because of its widespread accolades. I’m including a reviewer’s opinion, in case you want a better in-depth review of the game. ** Coin Drop! Developer: Full Fat Productions (What?) Price: $0.99 If you enjoyed Peggle, you are bound to enjoy Coin Drop!. Though both games share a Pachinko-style inspiration, Peggle is more creative with the idea. This isn’t to say Coin Drop!’s version of Pachinko is bad. It wouldn’t be on this list if it were bad! It is just different (it lacks Unicorns and Rainbows). I liked this game just as much as I liked Peggle, so I encourage Peggle fans to give this one a try.           Demolish Stuff!   Chaos Rings Omega Developer: Square Enix Price: $11.99 The sequel to one of the best iOS RPG games is here! More like, was here, but you get the point. This game is not as exciting as the original though, but is just as fulfilling. Both have a good sense of story and graphics are just as good as they were in the original.           Similar graphics to the original, if not better             Chaos Rings     6th Planet Developer: Monkube Price: $0.99 I debated what to put as the last spot,  but concluded 6th Planet rightfully deserves it. The plot behind the game is that our 6th planet, Saturn, has suddenly become habitable for humans to live. So they send a monkey to go investigate it and make sure it is a good place to live. You play as that monkey, as he explores the new planet in his space ship.           Great 2D Graphics             Comic-Book Style Story             6th Planet     And that concludes my list!

        "title": "How to Begin Programming Part I",
        "excerpt":"Programming is a dead useful knowledge one could acquire. It could be applied to any sciences job. It could help one create their own software tailored to their own usage. But beginning programming and mastering programming are two very separate things. Nonetheless, you need to start somewhere. Reason for Learning Everyone learns for their own reasons. If you enjoy programming, then you should definitely learn it  (this is paradoxical. If you know programming, then you already know how to). If you need to learn programming, you should figure out which language you should learn, depending on your job’s requirements. Which programming language to choose? With the thousands of programming languages out there, picking one may seem to be an arduous decision. But it actually is quite easy. Only about 30 of those languages are actually used today, commercially. The other 970+ languages are used by companies for their own purposes or individual developers. Your best bet is to learn a language that is widely known for 2 reasons: More people can help you and there is more documentation for the language. So how do you choose the language? You can look over the list of the most prolific languages and select one that you’d like to learn. But if you cannot decide, let’s take a logical approach. Ask yourself this: “Why would I need to learn a programming language? Which job do I have requires the use of programming?” Science and Mathematics If you work in sciences and mathematics fields, the programming may help you a lot. When you need to write a program to hold data or manipulate it, or when you need to find an accurate way of displaying data, knowledge of a solid programming language will help you much. In Sciences and Mathematics, the best computer languages are ones created by the user. Now this is incredibly far-fetched, but when one designs their own language, they can utilize it and tailor it exactly to their needs. But you’d need a computer sciences background to write a language compiler and interpreter, so you should stick to the learning path of a language. So for Sciences and Mathematics, you’d need a type of language that can handle piles of data, but remain tailored to your other research needs. The programming language you use doesn’t have to fast or pre-compiled, but being faster is a bonus.  So here are the three programming languages that you’d benefit most from.   Perl – Many believe Perl to be the new COBOL, but it has more uses than COBOL did. It works very easily when storing data and writing software to store data. It is pretty easy to learn.  Python – Named after Monty Python, this language lacks the speed of C++ or FORTRAN but is one of the easier mainstream languages to learn.  Ruby – This should be tried, only when Perl and Python have proven not to work for you. Ruby is the fusion of 5 programming languages (2 of which are esoteric) and lacks the amount of libraries that Python and Perl provide. It is also easy to learn, but not as efficient as the previous 2.**Computer Sciences and Engineering ** If you want to become a programmer as a full-time career, learning and acquiring 5+ languages is necessary. You need languages that can efficiently write programs, but depending on the type of program you specialize in, the speed at which the program works at should be accounted for. As an engineer, knowing 1 or 2 programming languages gives you the versatility when constructing devices and programming them (only if the devices are computers mind you). So here are 6 programming languages that are basic stuff to learn before majoring in Computer Sciences and what not.   C++ – A majority of programmers use this language and learn it first for 3 reasons; it is widespread, easy to use, and many languages are influenced by C++ syntax. C# and Java share much of their syntax with C++.  C – This isn’t necessary due to the fact it is being obsolesced by the newer C’s but if learned, makes any programming language that much easier. C inspired many other languages to come about.  Java – Has cross-platforming capabilities but is slow as heck. Many computers do work with it and it is considered by many to be the “greatest programming language ever.” It certainly is something of a language, despite its caveat.  Python – Becoming increasingly popular due to its easiness to learn and many uses it has. Since becoming a Computer Sciences major and eventually a programmer requires to learn the most popular and widespread languages first, Python should be learned.  Objective-C – If you want to go to the Apple side of the spectrum of major computer development, Objective-C is essential as you can efficiently develop iOS and MacOS applications.  C# – Objective-C’s counterpart for Windows. Thanks to Mono, you can develop C# on your Mac, but it has much more use when working with .NET.**Web Development and Networking ** Web Development requires one to learn many languages. Markup, Scripting, and Programming will all become a part of **the learning process. Here are 10 languages that would present much  use when beginning Web Development.   HTML – What Web Development requires at its bare-essentials. Technically, you only need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at least to make your website successful.  CSS – Organizes, colors, and cleans up the web pages you make.  JavaScript – Essential to know. It has uses outside of Web Development too, such as iOS development.  PHP – A beautiful language that connects your Database with your website. If you create a website that has any form of searching through a database, PHP is the best way to go.  Ruby on Rails – A framework that does a lot of the work for you when creating a website that resembles a blog. It created Twitter, Kongregate, Hulu, LivingSocial, and many other Web Applications.  XML – Used for transporting data to be displayed on the HTML page. It, in no way, replaces PHP. It’s main use, though, is to work with Javascript to create the language below…  AJAX – Okay, okay, stop yelling. AJAX is not a language. It is the mixture of Javascript and XML. GMail, Flickr, and GoogleMaps had much of their interfaces created by using AJAX in lieu of other bulky languages like Python.  Tcl/Perl – Tcl has some advantages over Perl, but it is mainly up to the preference of the user on which programming language would suit their needs. They are both Interpreted languages, but Tcl is newer (created in Feb. 2011) and Perl has more libraries and documentation.  Python – Very versatile. It can be used to create Internet applications as well as Computer applications. Most of YouTube was coded in Python and the video-interface was mainly coded in Python.  C# – Used to create server-side applications. Those of you who want to work with the .NET hooligans (I say this in the most affectionate way possible), C# could be of utmost help.  For the Heck of It  If you want to learn a programming language for the heck of it (God knows what reason passed through your head), then you should stick to learning either C++, Python, or Java. Python is easy to learn, Java is widespread, and C++ has many professional advantages. They each have their caveats which the other makes up for, i.e.: C++ is faster and Python and Java are slower to run. Python is easier to learn and Java and C++ are harder to learn.  So once you have decided the programming language you are going to learn, proceed to Part II for the next step in learning the programming language.

        "title": "Top Ten Text Editors and IDEs for Web Development",
        "excerpt":"I looked over many text editors and IDEs while looking for one that catered to all my specifications. I concluded that just 1 IDE or Text Editor wouldn’t suffice. So here are some of my favorite IDEs I tested. They are excellent and should be tested out. Komodo IDE Developer: ActiveState Price: $295 + $87 Subscription The premium version of Komodo Edit. Komodo IDE is an excellent developer’s environment. It contains all of the functions one would expect from a paid IDE (code coloring, automatic building and executing in a web browser), but it has a very clean and simple interface and the ability to work with a bucket load of programming languages. One should try out Komodo Edit before looking into Komodo IDE.           From the ActiveState Website   Komodo Edit Developer: ActiveState Price: Free An excellent IDE. One would expect it not to be as good as Komodo IDE, but this should be used before purchasing the full application. The program can do so much (color text, hyperlinks, projects, Python3 support). Some people choose to use Komodo Edit for XML work only (I guess they prefer other IDEs), but I really don’t see the difference between this IDE’s HTML capabilities and other Free IDE’s capabilities.           Very clean interface   TextMate Developer: Allen Odgaard Price: $57 This isn’t an IDE, it is a Text Editor…And it’s one of the most iconic of the Text Editors. It retains some of the features of an IDE (color coding, saving snippets, templates etc.) but it is a full-fledged Text Editor. Many consider Text Editors over IDEs because they are much more light-weight. If you don’t like IDEs too much, then TextMate is a great way to continue editing text in the most comfortable text editor-based way possible.           An example of LISP in TextMate             TextMate               Awesome&#8230;   Netbeans Developer: Oracle Corporation Price: Free Netbeans is an all-inclusive IDE. Although it dropped Rails support a few years back, it has maintained its poise as a reliable although at times clunky application. It is an excellent IDE for teaching computer science students or introducing them to programming. But, it does use up a lot of RAM memory so be prepared to deal with RAM allocation when using this IDE. RubyMine Developer: JetBrains Price: $69 + $39 (subscription) JetBrains has 3 IDEs that are meant for Web Development; RubyMine, PHPStorm, and WebStorm. PHPStorm and WebStorm are not very good IDEs as they have their functions limited to HTML, Javascript, CSS, XML, XSLT, SASS3, LESS and PHP. This can be 1) Lacking all the necessary language supports, 2) Inefficient because it lacks the necessary language supports. But RubyMine allows you to create Ruby applications (online and offline) and use the much-ado-about-something framework, Ruby on Rails. RubyMine is compatible with Javascript, SASS, HAML, LESS, HTML, and CSS also. AptanaStudio Developer: Aptana Price: Free Say what you want, I still like Aptana. It contains all of the features IDEs ought to have, as well as a Built in Terminal, Deployment Wizard, and Engine Yard, a very good Rails assistant. Though RadRails is not the best editor for Ruby on Rails and Ruby, it’s still a bonus.           Code Assist Feature   KompoZer Developer: Fabien Cazenave Price: Free KompoZer is based off of the defunct Nvu Editor. KompoZer is based on WYSIWYG, and has HTML, XML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities. It is not the best editor, but it can be used quite efficiently for beginning Web Development. If you are on a PC and want to begin Web Development, I suggest the next editor in lieu of KompoZer. Notepad++ Developer: Don Ho Price: Free Notepad++ is written entirely in C++, so for those of you picky, melodramatic programmers who think Java will destroy the world, here is your savior. Notepad++ has been downloaded 27 million times…I guess this means it’s a good program. It is based on Scintilla and contains many functions one would expect to see in a IDE. But it stands by the fact it is a text editor, so we have to respect that, and not insult it with the phrase “IDE.”           Notepad++   Coda Developer: Panic Price: $99 You can look over FTP servers quickly using Coda. It has a built-in Terminal. It even has a reference/instructional guide built-in to the program for learning how to begin Web development. These features are excellent, but what gives Coda it’s greatness, is the fact it has a beautiful CSS editor. Instead of writing “Font Family:Verdana,” it has an entire list of CSS features which you just enter the specifications you want, and BAM! It fills out the code for you.           The CSS Feature   HTML Notepad Developer: HTML Notepad Price: Free One of the best HTML editors. It works with HTML, XML, PHP, Perl, Python, CSS, and Javascript. The entire file is just 1.2 megabytes, making it a very lightweight program. It even has some great features such as color coding text and syntax highlighting. It’s a shame this program is only for Windows as it is an excellent editor.           HTML Notepad   ","categories": ["Programming","Software"],

        "title": "Euclideon Is Back With An Update On Their Unlimited Detail Real-Time Rendering Technology",
        "excerpt":"Last year, a technology company by the name of Euclideon showed off some technology they were working on that had to do with rendering unlimited detail graphics in real-time. After receiving much coverage by the media, they seemed to fade away. Recently, Euclideon published a video that showcased the progress that they have made with their graphics engine. [youtube_sc url=”http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00gAbgBu8R4″] The graphics that they show off are very impressive, and I’m sure they would be truly awesome if implemented in a  video game. There is, however, a lot of skepticism aimed at them. Other companies have been working on similar graphic technology, only to find that there are an overwhelming number of roadblocks. For one, these high-quality graphics would eat up a ton of memory and hard drive space. It is likely that they are hiding their weaknesses while they show of their best points. The biggest reason for this is to get more investors and funding (which I’m sure they will- video game companies are spending sleepless nights trying to increase their polygon count). The other thing to take note of is the lack of animation in their presentation. They say that they have since developed animation, but I imagine it’s very difficult. Notch, the developer behind the wildly popular game Minecraft, had a few things to say about the subject. In his blog posts, he points out several weaknesses shown in the video, the limitations of high quality graphics, and several existing game engines that already make use of similar technology. The core weaknesses that he pointed out include the sky-high amount of data unlimited graphics consume, the identical structures in the demo that suggest difficulty int he management of unique data, and that voxels (the tiny elements that make up the graphics, kind of like 3D pixels) are terrible for animation. Some game engines that he pointed out include Atomontage and Voxlap. Due to all this, Notch is calling Euclideon’s promotion of their technology a scam. Euclideon says their software development kit will be available “some months from now”. Is it going to be revolutionary? Is it actually going to happen? Is the usage of this unlimited detail technology in commercial video games feasible? I guess we’ll have to wait and find out. ","categories": ["Gaming","Software","Video"],

        "excerpt":" This review is on Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The gameplay is presented from a bird’s eye view. It doesn’t have good graphics and it lags a lot if you have about half of your iPhone with data on it. The game does have a really good story line, though, and if they just put a little more time into the glitches, and made it look more real compared to just a bunch of pictures, it would be a lot better. There is one part in the game when you go to do Lester’s first challenge on the motorcycle. As soon as you get to the right spot, the buttons freeze up and stop working. I have tried it about 7 times and each time it freezes. It does have a good open world platform but it still needs some work (like I said before). If I could make one small change I would make it so there were more layers. I say that as it should to have more depth in the objects and you should be able to walk into the buildings and talk to the people on the street (not just kill them). Overall- *** Graphics- * Story- **** Fighting- *** The going price is $9.99, and you can grab it here. ","categories": ["App Review"],

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 5 &#8211; Objects",
        "excerpt":" Hit the play button on your favorite music video, because it’s time for yet another tutorial on the awesome programming language that is Objective-C! In our last tutorial, we studied classes. In our code, we made the “Alien” class. This time ’round, we’re going to make an object. This object is going to be “Bill”. Bill is going to be a member of the Alien class. We briefly discussed what objects were in our last tutorial, but let’s go over them again anyways. Objects are basically things that inherit all the characteristics of the class that it is a member of. To put this into a  real life example, “Humans” could be a class of objects. Your best friend Tom would be an object that is a member of the class “Humans”. Tom would inherit (from the Human class) variables like height, gender, age, and weight. Some methods that he might inherit include tying his shoe and walking. Still don’t get it? Let’s go over creating objects that are members of a class.   Making An Object We are going to continue working with the code from our last tutorial. That code currently consists of the “Alien” class. Just like I promised, we are going to make the Alien “Bill”. Bill is going to be an object that is a member of the Alien class. When we declared the Alien class, we were working entirely outside of the main function. We are now going to start working in the main function, as that is where objects are declared. Here is the code we will use to create the object Bill:             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) output;            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            @end            @implementation Alien            -(void) output {            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars);            }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }            -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            Alien *Bill;            Bill = [Alien alloc];            Bill = [Bill init];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        Alien *Bill; We declare an object by giving the name of a class followed by an asterisk and the name of the object you want to create (this is called a pointer, we’ll be going over them in a future tutorial). In this line, we created the object “Bill” that is a member of the class “Alien”. Bill = [Alien alloc]; In this line, we allocate some memory for the object Bill. That is, we borrow some memory from the computer for our object to use. This is done by giving a declared object’s name, and setting it equal to “[Class alloc]” (replacing “Class” with the name of the class that the object is a member of). Bill = [Bill init]; Before we can use our object, we have to initialize it. This is done by giving a declared object’s name, and setting it equal to “[Object init]” (replacing “Object” with the name of the object). That’s all there is to creating an object!   Using Methods Now that we’ve created our object, we want to use the methods that our object inherited from the Alien class.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) output;            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            @end            @implementation Alien            -(void) output {            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars);            }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }            -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            Alien *Bill;            Bill = [Alien alloc];            Bill = [Bill init];            [Bill setNumberOfEyes: 8];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        [Bill setNumberOfEyes: 8]; To call upon one of the methods that we declared in the Alien class, we put, inside of square brackets, the name of the object followed by the name of the method. If the method needs some kind of value passed into it, then we follow the function name with a colon and the value. In this case, we are using the setNumberOfEyes method and providing it with a value of 8. In our @Implementation section, we made the setNumberOfEyes method take whatever value was passed into it and set the variable NumberOfEyes equal to it. And, just like that, we used the setNumberOFEyes method to give Bill 8 eyes. Now that we’ve gone over how to use one method, let’s use all of the methods that we declared.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) output;            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            @end            @implementation Alien            -(void) output {            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars);            }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }            -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            Alien *Bill;            Bill = [Alien alloc];            Bill = [Bill init];            [Bill setNumberOfEyes: 8];            [Bill setAge: 344];            [Bill setNumberOfEars: 3];            [Bill output];            [Bill release];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        [Bill output]; The setAge and setNumberOfEars methods are pretty straightforward, but the output method could use a little narration. Unlike the other methods, it doesn’t need any arguments (values passed into it). What it does is take the variables that we set values for (with the other methods) and plugs them into the sentence we declared in the output method in the@implementation section. It then NSLog’s (outputs) the sentence to the console. [Bill release]; Remember how we allocated, or borrowed, some memory from the computer for our Bill object? Well, now we need to release, or give back, that memory. That is done with the line “[Object release];” (replacing “Object” with the name of the object). That’s it. We’re done. We created the object Bill. Bill was a member of the Alien class. We ran some methods that set the values of some of Bill’s variables (that he inherited from the Alien class) and then plugged those variables into a sentence and outputted that sentence to the screen. What? You haven’t done that last thing yet? Whoops. Let’s do that now. If you haven’t opened your console window already, do so now by going to Run -&gt; Console. Next, hit that shiny “Build and Run” button. The sentence  “The alien is 344 years old and has 8 eyes and 3 ears.” should be outputted to the console window. Feeling brave? try creating your own alien with different numbers of eyes and ears!  So ya. That’s all folks. See you next time! I’m not yet sure what the next tutorial is going to be about.

        "title": "PHP Tutorial 3 &#8211; Variables And Comments",
        "excerpt":" Let’s see if we can squeeze in another tutorial before a massive asteroid smashes into the Earth. In our last mind-boggling  PHP tutorial, we made our first web page using PHP. This time around, we are going to cover variables and comments.   Variables If you’ve worked with other programming languages, or have taken a basic Algebra class, then you probably already know what a variable is. In programming, a variable is a name that can represent an assigned value. For example, we could have a variable called “X”. It doesn’t represent a value on its own, so we’ll need to assign it a value. Let’s assign the value “1” to X. Now, we have a variable “X” with an assigned value of “1”. Variables in programming aren’t limited to numbers; We could assign the phrase “Row Row Row Your Boat” to X. In PHP, we declare a variable by simply giving a name for the variable, and setting it equal to a value. A dollar sign is placed immediately before the name of the variable as to tell the computer that the name is in fact a name for a variable, and not a function or other statement.             &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;?php$number = 5;$words = 'Byte Revel Rocks';$boolean = true;?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;        In the code above, we declared three variables and set them equal to three different kinds of values. The first is an integer, the second is a string of text, and the third is boolean. If you are coming from another programming language, you are probably both shocked and relieved that you don’t have to declare a data type. If you didn’t quite understand what I was saying earlier about declaring variables, you can probably follow the above variable declarations. They’re as easy as a dollar sign followed by the name of your variable, and an equal sign followed by the value you want to assign the variable. Think “$variablename = value;”. Variables can be named with any combination of alphanumeric characters, with one exception. You can’t have a variable name that is just a number. Depending on what kind of value you want to assign a variable, you may or may not use quotation marks around your value. Both numbers and boolean values will not have quotes around them, while strings (words) will. What’s that? You’re not familiar with the boolean data type? It’s quite simple really. It can either be “true” or “false”. Now that we’ve created some variables and assigned them some values, let’s go over outputting the value of a variable to the screen. You may recall that we used a function called “echo” in our last tutorial. Well, we are going to use that again to display the values of our variables.             &lt;html&gt;            &lt;head&gt;            &lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;            &lt;/head&gt;            &lt;body&gt;            &lt;?php            $number = 5;            $words = 'Byte Revel Rocks';            $boolean = false;            echo $number;            echo $words;            ?&gt;            &lt;/body&gt;            &lt;/html&gt;        The above code will output “5Byte Revel Rocks”. Similarly to how we outputted text in our last tutorial using the statement ” echo “Hello World”; “, we use the echo function followed by the name of the variable to output the value of the variable. Take note that I didn’t echo the boolean variable. This is because the computer reads boolean values as “1” if it is true, and “0” if it is false. Using the echo function, boolean variables either result in an outputted “1” or nothing. Echo’ing boolean variables isn’t very useful. You’re probably thinking that “5Byte Revel Rocks” is pretty ugly. Let’s stick the variables inside of a string of text to pretty them up (and make them more useful).             &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;?php$number = 5;$words = 'Byte Revel Rocks';$boolean = false;echo \"My favorite number is $number, and $words\";?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;        The above code will output “My favorite number is 5, and Byte Revel Rocks”. Pretty cool, eh? Including variables in strings of text is as easy as inserting the name of the variable into the string of text. Alternatively, you can include the values of variables inside echo statements through an operation called concatenation. To do this, simply put a “.” between each string of text and and each variable. Make sure that all strings of text are enclosed by quotation marks. Like so:             &lt;html&gt;            &lt;head&gt;            &lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;            &lt;/head&gt;            &lt;body&gt;            &lt;?php            $number = 5;            $words = 'Byte Revel Rocks';            $boolean = false;            echo \"My favorite number is \".$number.\", and \".$words;            ?&gt;            &lt;/body&gt;            &lt;/html&gt;          Comments           \"Commented\" by XKCD   In programming, comments are sections of text inside the program that aren’t run. They are marked with certain characters so that the computer knows to skip over them. They are most commonly used to add annotations, or notes, to the code. They can also be used to temporarily “mute” parts of a program. The syntax for comments in PHP is the same as C, C++, and Perl (or rather, it allows you to use the syntax from any of those languages).             &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Cool PHP Page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;?php// this is a single-line comment# this is a single-line comment/* this is a multi-line comment */?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;        The above code will output absolutely nothing, and I believe it is pretty self explanatory.    ","categories": ["PHP"],

        "title": "iOS 5 To Have Earthquake Warning System For Users In Japan",
        "excerpt":"I’m sure you remember the powerful 8.9 magnitude earthquake that ravaged Japan earlier this year. Some 20,000 people were left dead or missing as a result of it. Imagine how less devastating it could have been if there were a better earthquake warning system in Japan. That’s the idea behind a new feature introduced in the most recent iOS5 beta. Thanks to Apple, iPhone users in Japan will be able to turn on an early earthquake warning system that will notify them when Japan’s earthquake warning centers detect an earthquake.  When Japan’s earthquake warning system detects an earthquake (usually a couple minutes before the earthquake hits), a warning will be pushed to users’ devices through their carrier. In this way, earthquake warnings will spread more quickly and widely. The Japanese text above warns of shortened battery life as a result of this service. That makes sense, as your phone would need to be constantly connected to The earthquake warning system. As David Daw pointed out, battery life seems like a small price to pay for the protection that the service would provide you with. Heck, that problem could even be resolved with an iPhone case with a battery in it. The system isn’t perfect, though. It is occasionally unreliable, as Japan’s earthquake warning system doesn’t always detect an earthquake when it should. Sometimes it detects an earthquake when there isn’t one, which could cause much panic. Other times, the earthquake isn’t detected until it has already hit.           \"TornadoGuard\" by XKCD   There are already several apps on the app store that provide similar services, but they aren’t as convenient (and probably not as accurate and fast). Why Japan? Why not in other countries? Most likely, Apple thought that Japan was the best place to start, and they will roll out similar features to other countries in the future. Oh, and in related news, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake lightly struck Japan this morning. It was centered about 140 miles off the coast, and there was no Tsunami. ","categories": ["iOS"],

        "title": "Objective-C Tutorial 6 &#8211; Returning The Values Of Instance Variables",
        "excerpt":" Hip hip, hooray! It’s time for another Objective-C tutorial. I’m going to try to keep this one short but sweet, as it is intended to add some additional information to our last tutorial. I’ll be talking about using instance variables in our main function. An instance variable is a variable that is defined within a class. For example, we had the class Alien in our last tutorial. The variable “NumberOfEyes” that was inside of our Alien class is an instance variable. We can’t access instance variables directly from our main function. Instead, we need to create another method that returns the value of our instance variables (only methods can access instance variables directly). These kinds of methods are referred to as “getter” methods because they “get” the values of the instance variables. In the program that we’ll be creating, we will replace the “output” method that we used in our last tutorial with  an NSLog statement in our main function. In order to accomplish this, we’ll need to use some getter methods that return the values of our instance variables.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;             }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            -(int) NumberOfEyes;            -(int) Age;            -(int) NumberOfEars;            @end             @implementation Alien             -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }             -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }             -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }             -(int) NumberOfEyes {            return NumberOfEyes;            }            -(int) Age {            return Age;            }            -(int) NumberOfEars {            return NumberOfEars;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {            NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            Alien *Bill;            Bill = [Alien alloc];            Bill = [Bill init];             [Bill setNumberOfEyes: 8];                    [Bill setAge: 344];                           [Bill setNumberOfEars: 3];                   int NumberOfEyes = [Bill NumberOfEyes];            int Age = [Bill Age];            int NumberOfEars = [Bill NumberOfEars];            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars);            [Bill release];             [pool drain];            return 0;            }        The above code will output “The alien is 344 years old and has 8 eyes and 3 ears.” -(int) NumberOfEyes; -(int) Age; -(int) NumberOfEars; As you might recall from our tutorial about classes, we need to declare our methods in the @interface section of the class. All of the methods that we have created prior to this tutorial didn’t need to return anything. Because of this, we put “void” in the parentheses. Now, we want our methods to return the values of our instance variables. All of our instance variables are integers, so we will want to return integers. Similar to how we use “int” to declare an integer variable, we will use “int” to tell the computer that we are going to be returning an integer. -(int) NumberOfEyes { return NumberOfEyes; } -(int) Age { return Age; } -(int) NumberOfEars { return NumberOfEars; } Now that we’ve declared our methods in the @interface, we need to give our methods some code to run. First, copy the method declaration (minus the semicolon) and paste it in the implementation. Then, open the body of the method with an opening curly bracket. The code that we want inside of our methods is “return instancevariable” (replacing “instancevariable” with the corresponding name of the instance variable that we want the value of). This “return” statement is how we return values in our methods. In our NumberOfEyes method, the value of the instance variable “NumberOfEyes” is returned. When writing code in the main function, we will be able to call this method and, once the “return” statement is run, we will receive the value of “NumberOfEyes”. int NumberOfEyes = [Bill NumberOfEyes]; int Age = [Bill Age]; int NumberOfEars = [Bill NumberOfEars]; You’ve declared variables before. Nothing new there. But wait, what’s this crazy looking [Bill NumberOfEyes] ? We’re just calling the method “NumberOfEyes”. That’s right, we can set a variable equal to the returned value of a method. NSLog(@”The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.”, Age, NumberOfEyes, NumberOfEars); Nothing new here either, we’re just plugging some variables into an NSLog statement.   A Shortcut Instead of setting variables equal to the returned value of a method, we can just call the methods from inside the NSLog statement.             #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;            @interface Alien : NSObject {            int NumberOfEyes;            int Age;            int NumberOfEars;            }            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i;            -(void) setAge: (int) a;            -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e;            -(int) NumberOfEyes;            -(int) Age;            -(int) NumberOfEars;            @end             @implementation Alien            -(void) setNumberOfEyes: (int) i {            NumberOfEyes = i;            }            -(void) setAge: (int) a {            Age = a;            }             -(void) setNumberOfEars: (int) e {            NumberOfEars = e;            }             -(int) NumberOfEyes {            return NumberOfEyes;            }            -(int) Age {            return Age;            }            -(int) NumberOfEars {            return NumberOfEars;            }            @end            int main (int argc, const char * argv[]) {                NSAutoreleasePool * pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];            Alien *Bill;            Bill = [Alien alloc];            Bill = [Bill init];            [Bill setNumberOfEyes: 8];            [Bill setAge: 344];            [Bill setNumberOfEars: 3];            NSLog(@\"The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.\", [Bill Age], [Bill NumberOfEyes], [Bill NumberOfEars]);            [Bill release];            [pool drain];                return 0;            }        The above code will output “The alien is 344 years old and has 8 eyes and 3 ears.” NSLog(@”The alien is %i years old and has %i eyes and %i ears.”, [Bill Age], [Bill NumberOfEyes], [Bill NumberOfEars]); And there you have it, a much simpler and compact way to get the values of the instance variables and output them to the screen.

        "title": "Steve Jobs Resigned As CEO Of Apple",
        "excerpt":" Earlier today, Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, resigned. Here’s the full letter of resignation that he sent to the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community today:   I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.   I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.   As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple.   I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.   I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.   -Steve Apple later published a press release regarding his resignation and their decision on the next CEO:   Apple’s Board of Directors today announced that Steve Jobs has resigned as Chief Executive Officer, and the Board has named Tim Cook, previously Apple’s Chief Operating Officer, as the company’s new CEO. Jobs has been elected Chairman of the Board and Cook will join the Board, effective immediately.   “Steve’s extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple and guided it to its position as the world’s most innovative and valuable technology company,” said Art Levinson, Chairman of Genentech, on behalf of Apple’s Board. “Steve has made countless contributions to Apple’s success, and he has attracted and inspired Apple’s immensely creative employees and world class executive team. In his new role as Chairman of the Board, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.”   “The Board has complete confidence that Tim is the right person to be our next CEO,” added Levinson. “Tim’s 13 years of service to Apple have been marked by outstanding performance, and he has demonstrated remarkable talent and sound judgment in everything he does.”   Jobs submitted his resignation to the Board today and strongly recommended that the Board implement its succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO.   As COO, Cook was previously responsible for all of the company’s worldwide sales and operations, including end-to-end management of Apple’s supply chain, sales activities, and service and support in all markets and countries. He also headed Apple’s Macintosh division and played a key role in the continued development of strategic reseller and supplier relationships, ensuring flexibility in response to an increasingly demanding marketplace.   Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App Store, and has recently introduced iPad 2 which is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices. For 15 years, Steve has led Apple through good and bad times. He helped develop the incredible culture that exists around the world today through the many groundbreaking products he designed and launched (with the help of the massive team of people at Apple). If it weren’t for Steve, technology would not be as greatly developed and user friendly as it is today. Microsoft would dominate even more of the market, and with great monopoly comes poor innovation. Back in the 1970’s, Steve kicked off the multi-billion dollar company that is Apple with the help of  Steve Wozniak and Mike Markkula. They developed and the Apple II, the earliest successful series of PCs that revolutionized the computer market.  After the success of their Apple II computers, the staff of Apple gradually grew until a large development team created the first version of the now widely known Macintosh operating system (named after McIntosh apples). The operating system even had a graphic user interface, and it was controlled  by a mouse. It was released in January 24th, 1984.  Due to conflict between Steve and the board of directors, he resigned from his position at Apple later that year. This turned out to be the right move, as he went on to develop NeXT. While running NeXT, he acquired Pixar Animation Studios. The computer platform NeXT became good enough that Apple actually bought it, bringing Steve back to Apple. Starting in 1997, he started his 15-year reign as CEO. During his reign, Pixar was sold to the Walt Disney company, Macintosh was much further developed, several new lines of personal computers were designed and released, the wildly popular line of iPods was made, a mobile OS (iOS) was made, Apple created an amazing smartphone, the first successful tablet computer (the iPad) was developed, and many developers and geeks found jobs and money through Apple’s numerous products and services. Steve Jobs has led a great business life, and it seems that he can’t take the stress and responsibility that running a massive company  burdens him with. In addition, he is still struggling through several health conditions, and his resignation gives him more time to recover. Complying with Steve’s request, the board of directors chose Tim Cook, Apple’s Chief Operating Officer, to take his place. He has already shown that he is capable of running the company by standing in for Steve when he was out getting treatment for his pancreatic cancer. As could be expected, Apple shares dropped almost $20 when the announcement became public. With any luck in Apple’s part, this was just a small bump in the road, and shares will continue to rise steadily. Steve lasted three more years of than his competitor and fellow technology business founder Bill Gates, who resigned back in 2006. Both were born in 1955. They didn’t just drop all contact and support for their companies either, each chose a to play a more minor role in his company. To quote that one developer who always yelled out during Steve Jobs’s presentations, “We love you Steve!” UPDATE: Apple as updates their executive profile page on Apple.com with the position changes for Steve Jobs and Tim Cook.

        "title": "Understanding The Binary Numeral System (Base Two Numbering System)",
        "excerpt":"The binary numeral system is a numbering system that uses the digits 1 and 0. It is also referred to as the “base two numbering system” due to the fact that two different numbers are used. Contrary to popular belief, the system is rather easy to learn.           \"Su Doku\" by XKCD   You are most familiar with the base 10 numbering system, also known as the decimal system, in which 10 different numbers are used and their position describes what power of ten  they are to be multiplied by. These 10 digits are combined to form any number, and the numbers formed can be used in mathematical problems. Similarly, in the binary numeral system the numbers 1 and 0 are combined to form any number. The positions of the 1’s and 0’s describes whether or not certain values of the power of two are on. The values of the powers of two that are on are added together, resulting in the base 10 equivalent. Because of the on-off nature of the binary numeral system, it is heavily used in technology. Circuits can be in one of two states: on or off (think light switch). Computer storage processes are made up of large sequences of these states, and they are interpreted as binary. The number 1 is the on state, and 0 the off state. Each digit of a binary number represents a power of two. These powers of two can be seen in the following table (“^” means the following number is an exponent):             2^7                  2^6                  2^5                   2^4                  2^3                  2^2                  2^1                  2^0                     128                   64                   32                   16                   8                   4                  2                  1        Those are essentially the values that are represented by the 1’s and 0’s in an 8-bit binary number. Now it’s time to look at a binary number.             Powers Of Two That The Binary Numbers Represent:                  128                  64                  32                  16                  8                  4                  2                  1                    Binary Number:                  1                                          1                  1                                            Our binary number is 10011000, or 152 in base 10. As stated above, the binary digit “1” means that the corresponding power of two is “on”, as it were. The combined values of the “on” powers of two are the base 10 number (128 + 16 + 8 = 152). Here’s a chart of the binary numbers 1-13 and their corresponding base 10 value:             Base 10                  Binary (Base 2)                    1                  00000001                    2                  00000010                    3                  00000011                    4                  00000100                    5                  00000101                    6                  00000110                    7                  00000111                    8                  00001000                    9                  00001001                    10                  00001010                    11                  00001011                    12                  00001100                    13                  00001101        In common usage, the zeroes that are to the right of the right-most 1 are left out.           Congratulations! You're now the former!     You should now have a basic understanding of binary, and you can test yourself by converting the following numbers to binary: Number: 15 Binary Answer (highlight): 00001111 Number: 33 Binary Answer (highlight): 00100001 Got them? Good! You may notice that the highest 8-bit number that can be reached with the binary numeral system is 255. That means that there are 256 possible values that can be in an 8-bit file. Larger bit types allow for many more possible values, and are more practical for modern computing. The computer that you are using right now is probably running a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. The origin of the term “bit” should make this more clear: bit = binary digits. Now that you know how to convert base 10 numbers (decimal system) to base 2 (binary), converting base 2 to base 10 should be a snap. All you have to do is imagine the powers of 2 that each binary digit represents and add up all the ones that are represented by 1’s. Test yourself: Binary: 01100011 Decimal Answer (highlight): 99 Wow! You got it! Awesome! As you can see, understanding binary isn’t that difficult. Now you can go amaze your friends with your undoubtable geekiness! ","categories": ["Computer Science"],

        "title": "Ruby On Rails Tutorial 1 &#8211; Setting Up The Environment",
        "excerpt":"   Ruby on Rails is a web-app framework that is written in the Ruby programming language. Since its release in 2004, it has quickly gained popularity in the developer community. It aims to make developing web applications easier, efficient, and fun. In order to maximize developer efficiency, it is designed so that the best ways to do things are encouraged, and other ways discouraged. Plus, it takes less code to accomplish things than in alternative frameworks. Similar to PHP, Rails code is run server side and can communicate with SQL databases. Rails is open-source, and, as a result, is more stable, secure, and available. In addition, it’s completely free. Some famous websites that run on Rails include Twitter, Hulu, Github, Groupon, Jango, and more. Some of these websites, like Twitter, have found that Rails doesn’t scale very well (when you are running a web-app with millons of visitors, Rails is either too slow or too limited). Because of this, they are considering moving to alternatives.   Installing On Windows Install Ruby Go to http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167 and download the .exe file for the latest version of Ruby. Run the installation wizard, and, on the second page of the installer, the page asking you what components you want to install, uncheck “SciTE” and check “Enable RubyGems”. Continue clicking through the defaults of the installer, and install anywhere you want. Install Rails To make sure you installed RubyGems correctly, open command prompt (Start Menu -&gt; Run, and type “CMD”) and type in “gem”. You should see a fairly long message regarding Gems. If not, try running the installer again and make sure “RubyGems” is checked. If all went well, type in “gem install rails –include-dependencies”. Install MySQL Go to  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ and choose “Microsoft Windows” in the “Select Platform” drop-down menu. Click the “.msi” download link for the version that corresponds with your version of Windows. Click the “No thanks, just take me to the downloads!” link near the bottom of the page, and click the download server nearest you. Run the installer, leaving everything default except for the “Modify Security Settings” page. Uncheck it. Next, download HeidiSQL. This will provide you with a GUI for your MySQL databases. Download An IDE/Editor When editing your project, you will want a text editor that is capable of understanding Ruby syntax. Having a file drawer within the app is very helpful. There are a number of good Ruby IDE’s out there, some of the best being Intype, RubyMine (30-day free trial), Ruby in Steel (60-day trial), ZeusEdit,and E-Texteditor (30-day free trial). Try ’em all out and use the one you like the best. Intype and ZeusEdit are free, so use those if you don’t want to buy anything.   Installing On Macintosh Install Ruby &amp; Rails Guess what? You’re already done! Ruby and Ruby on Rails come pre-installed on the Mac OS. Apple wants to make their computers more appealing to developers, and one way they do this is by pre-installing several programming languages onto them. Your current version may be slightly outdated by now, but it should do. Updating it can pose as a major and unnecessary hassle. Plus, Linux should be used if you are serious about running Rails on a server. Install MySQL Go to http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ and select “Mac OS X” in the “Select Platform” drop-down menu. Download a DMG archive that corresponds with your system.Once downloaded, open the DMG and run the .pkg that looks roughly like “mysql-5.1.58-osx10.60x86_64.pkg”. Next, double click the “MySQL.prefPane” in the DMG to install the System Preference window for MySQL that will allow you to start and stop your MySQL server. After you’ve done that, download Sequel Pro, which will provide you with a GUI for managing your databases. Download An IDE/Editor When editing your project, you will want a text editor that is capable of understanding Ruby syntax. Having a file drawer within the app is very helpful. The best Ruby on Rails IDE out there is TextMate. It’s not free, but they offer a 30-day trial that you should definitely take advantage of. Once your trial runs out, you can try some hopelessly inferior alternatives like MacVim, Xcode, or Komodo Edit.   Running The Server Now that we’ve downloaded and installed all of the applications and libraries we need, we can create a default Rails app and view it in the browser. On Windows First, we need to create our app. To do this, open up command prompt (Start Menu -&gt; Run, and type “CMD”) and navigate to the directory on your computer where you want your projects to install. Use the commands “dir” to see the contents of the directory you are currently in and “cd” followed by the name of a folder in your current directory to navigate to that folder. I suggest simply making a folder named “rails” on the first level of your local drive and typing “cd rails”. When you are in your desired folder, type “rails helloworld”. This will create the helloworld project folder in your current directory. While in the helloworld directory, type “ruby script/server” to start the Rails server. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser, and you should see the Rails “Welcome Aboard” page. Congratulations! You’re all done setting up your Rails environment and are ready to start coding! On Macintosh First, we need to create our app. To do this, open Terminal and navigate to a desired location on your system using “ls” to list all of the folders and files in your current directory, and “cd” followed by a folder name to navigate into a folder. I suggest simply typing “mkdir rails” as soon as you open terminal to make a folder called “rails” in your home directory (and then type “cd rails” to navigate into it). When you are in the folder where you want to create your project folder, type “rails helloworld” to make a folder with all of the default project files in it. When creating a project, you use the “rails projectname” command (replacing “projectname” with your project name). Next, navigate to that folder in terminal. If you haven’t closed your Terminal window, then you should be able to get to your project folder by typing “cd helloworld”. Now we can actually start the server. Type “script/server”. If all went well, you should now see a “Welcome Aboard” page at http://localhost:3000 . Congratulations! You’re all done setting up your Rails environment and are ready to start coding!

        "excerpt":"After your computer sits unused for a certain amount of time, a special program called a “screensaver” runs. It may display anything from a beautiful animation, to some bland, bouncing text. The purpose of these screensavers is to, well, save your screen. They help prevent screen burn-in, which is a sort of ghost image caused by pixels displaying the same color over a long period of time. Today, screensavers are usually used for entertainment or aesthetical purposes. If set to, they may be followed by a login field when activity is sensed. This provides a layer of security. Screensavers are often downloaded in one of two forms. One being a .saver file, and the other an installer package. To install the former, double-click the .saver file. You will be prompted to install the screensaver. To install the latter, simply double-click the installer and click through the installation process.

        "title": "How To Reformat Your USB Flash Drive",
        "excerpt":"   I recently found the need to dig out and dust off my old USB flash drive in order to be able to transfer files between computers. Upon plugging in my flash drive, I found that there were about 300 megabytes available. That is, 300 MB of available space on my completely empty 4 GB flash drive. What the heck? How is that possible? It turns out that there is a hidden trash folder that Mac OS X creates on the flash drive. When files are deleted on the flash drive through Finder, the files are actually moved to a hidden “.Trashes” folder on the flash drive. If you don’t empty the trash before removing your flash drive, these files will remain in this hidden folder and will take up precious storage space. Disgusting. This problem can usually be remedied by plugging in the flash drive to a computer and emptying the Trash. If you find yourself having this trouble often, or if you work with many external storage units like flash drives and SD cards, you may want to check out a $10 application (with 30-day free trial) called BlueHarvest. It automatically removes these hidden folders and files from your flash drives, SD cards, file servers, and more. I haven’t tried it out myself, but it has good reviews and it looks like a viable solution. While reformatting my flash drive probably wasn’t necessary, I had a bunch of odd system files on it and I thought it would be a good idea to just delete everything and start with a brand new file system. If you want to completely wipe your flash drive and start fresh, then you will want to reformat it. Some other reasons for doing this are   If you are going to sell your flash drive, then you will want to get rid of all the data on it  If you need to change the format of your flash drive for reasons like file size limit or usability on certain operating systems  The file system on your flash drive is a hopeless mess and you want to quickly and easily clean it up  You are having storage issues with your flash drive  You are having file corruption issues on your flash drive  To check for damaged sectors of your flash drive  Reformatting A USB Flash Drive On A Mac   Plug in the flash drive to your computer  Open Disk Utility (Applications -&gt; Utilities -&gt; Disk Utility, or search for “Disk Utility” in Spotlight)  In the list of drives that are connected to your computer, select your flash drive. This should be the one that is labeled with a description of the drive rather than the name of your drive. Mine is “4.02 GB SanDisk Cruzer Media”. There should be a mounted volume that looks like a sub-drive of your flash drive.  Go to the “Erase” tab  Select the desired format (you probably want “Mac OS Extended (Journaled)”)  Give a name for your flash drive  Click the “Erase…” button  Follow any on-screen instructions  Give yourself a pat on the back- you’re done!  Reformatting A USB Flash Drive On Windows   Plug in the flash drive to your computer  Go to My Computer  Right-click your flash drive and select “Format…”  Select which format (“File System”) you want your flash drive to be reformatted to. You can do some research on this if you want, but you probably want to go with FAT32.  Choose an allocation unit size. You probably want to leave this to the default, but if you have a large flash drive or you intend to store large files on it then you might want to increase the allocation size. Otherwise, a smaller allocation unit size might suit you better; try 512 bytes.  Give your flash drive a name by typing it in the “Volume Label” box  Click “Start”  Click “OK” in the window that pops up  Give yourself a pat on the back- you’re done!","categories": ["How To"],

        "excerpt":"AI, or artificial intelligence, has been around for quite a while now. It forms a complicated branch of computer science in which computers are programmed to emulate the intellectual abilities of humans. Commonly used in computer games, it brings a new level of interaction between humans and glaring machines. The most complicated form of artificial intelligence is sensical speech. For many years, AI programmers have been working hard to develop the conversational abilities of computers to the point that conversation with them is indistinguishable from that with a real human. The primitive versions of these “chatbots” were capable of extremely basic text-based conversations with an intelligence just below that of a confused pre-schooler. Now, chatbot technology has advanced to the point where humans can have endless, sensical conversations with computers. However, we’re still not quite to the point where computers could be mistaken for humans. The smarter chatbots collect and analyze data from their conversations, effectively becoming more intelligent and conversationally capable all the time. One such piece of advanced chatbot software is Cleverbot. Programmed by AI expert Rollo Carpenter, Cleverbot has had (and continues to have) millions of conversations with humans over the internet. It learns from its conversations, and consequently becomes smarter every day. After showing off its capabilities, Cleverbot won the 2010 British Computer Society Machine Intelligence Competition. Chatbots typically have conversations with humans, but what would happen if they have conversations with other chatbots? That was the question that led some researchers at Cornell University to create an interesting system. With their computer rig, two chatbots can converse with each other. The chatbots are programmed with the AI of Cleverbot, as is made obvious in their conversation. Their first conversation commenced with a greeting. They quickly become angry with each other and, after some smart-alecky lines, start saying nonsense. You can watch the full conversation below:      Even though the conversation was a bit absurd, it made sense for the most part. I dare say it was even entertaining.   This shows one of the things AI is capable of without human interaction. I can see this going even further when AI advances to the point where two chatbots could have meaningful conversation about topics relevant to society. Imagine two chatbots debating over resource consumption, presidential candidates, or even the meaning of life. Or, on the entertainment side, there could be a reality show generated by a couple of chatbots.  AI has the potential to revolutionize the way computers are used in society, whether that be for the better or for the worse.           \"AI\" by XKCD   ","categories": ["Computer Science"],

To get the ball rolling today, I will be reviewing N.O.V.A. for the iPhone/iPod Touch.  I realize that the game is kind of old, but I just wanted to put this out there so people will know about it.  This game is based in a place where intergalactic space marines are aboard a ship that gets hijacked by a group of aliens.  What you have to do is fight off all of the space aliens on the ship.  It is kind of like Halo for the iPhone. I am a little disappointed by the controls because they are kind of tight, but it still is a really good game. In addition to a fun single-player game, they  have online mode where you can connect with other people and participate in space battles.  It can support up to ten systems at once, which is really good compared to something like Brothers In Arms.  This game was made and produced by Gameloft, and is part of their large collection of premium games. The game costs $2.99 , and I believe that it is worth every penny of it.

        "title": "Cocos2D For iPhone Tutorial 3 &#8211; Moving Sprites",
        "excerpt":" In our last tutorial, we covered making a sprite appear on the screen. In this tutorial, we will be moving a sprite across the screen by using a technique called “animation”. In animation, a succession of new positions are combined to give the illusion of movement. Think “Steamboat Willie”, the famous Walt Disney cartoon. It was created with thousands of drawings all strung together and played in quick succession. Similarly, we will set a new position for our sprite in every frame. This new position will be right next to the last, and when the app is opened, these frames containing the new positions will be played in quick succession. Unlike cartoons, however, this animation will only consist of the movement of a single static object.    To begin the coding process for animating our sprite, we must first have a sprite. We already did that in the last tutorial, so let’s simply work with that code. If you don’t already have it, go to the last tutorial and copy and paste the code into Xcode. The things that we will need to add to our program in order to accomplish animation include a line that will call a method every frame, and the method that is called every frame.             #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"            CCSprite *icon;            @implementation HelloWorld            +(id) scene            {            CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];            HelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];            [scene addChild: layer];            return scene;            }            -(id) init            {            if( (self=[super init] )) {            icon = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@\"Icon.png\"];            icon.position = ccp(300,200);            [self addChild:icon];            [self schedule:@selector(DoEveryFrame:)];            }            return self;            }            - (void) dealloc            {            [super dealloc];            }            -(void) DoEveryFrame: (ccTime)dt{            icon.position = ccp(icon.position.x + 150*dt, icon.position.y);            }            @end        [self schedule:@selector(DoEveryFrame:)]; This line will run the “schedule” method of the “self” object. When calling a method that is in the same class as the method you are working on, you use “self” instead of the name of your object to refer to the class. In this case, our class is CCLayer. The “schedule” method runs the method that is passed into it every frame. The method that we are passing into it is “DoEveryFrame.”   -(void) DoEveryFrame: (ccTime)dt{ icon.position = ccp(icon.position.x + 150*dt, icon.position.y); } This is the method “DoEveryFrame.” It requires that that the paramater “ccTime” be passed into it. The variable “dt” will be set equal to “ccTime” so that we can use it in our method code. ccTime will give us the difference in time from when the DoEveryFrame method was last called. The only line of code in our method is going to be the one that sets a new position for our sprite. It basically sets the position equal to the point with an x-coordinate that is the current x-coordinate plus 150 pixels times the difference in time since the last frame (usually fractions of a second), and a y-coordinate  that is the same as the current y-coordinate. The net effect is that our sprite will appear to slide right on our screen. The reason we use the difference in time is to make sure that the sprite moves 150 pixels a second no matter what the frame rate is. If we run the program now, the cocos2d icon will appear on the screen and then slide to the right. It keeps on going even after it goes off the screen. The next thing we’re going to to is prevent it from going off screen by resetting its position to the left side of the screen once it’s reached the right side of the screen. We can do this with a simple if-else statement that essentially says “if the x-coordinate is greater than this value, then change the x-coordinate to this.”             #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"            CCSprite *icon;            @implementation HelloWorld            +(id) scene            {            CCScene *scene = [CCScene node];            HelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];            [scene addChild: layer];            return scene;            }            -(id) init            {            if( (self=[super init] )) {            icon = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@\"Icon.png\"];            icon.position = ccp(300,200);            [self addChild:icon];            [self schedule:@selector(DoEveryFrame:)];            }            return self;            }            - (void) dealloc            {            [super dealloc];            }            -(void) DoEveryFrame: (ccTime)dt{            icon.position = ccp(icon.position.x + 150*dt, icon.position.y);            if (icon.position.x &gt; 480+30) {            icon.position = ccp(-30, icon.position.y);            }            }            @end        if (icon.position.x &gt; 480+30) { icon.position = ccp(-30, icon.position.y); } This is the if-else statement. In plain English, it says “If the x-coordinate of the icon sprite is greater than 480 + 30, then set its  x-coordinate to -30 and leave the y-coordinate the same as it currently is.” The reason we chose 480 + 30 as the x-coordinate at which the position is reset is because the width of the screen is 480 pixels, and half the width of our sprite is 30 pixels. That way, the icon re-appears on the left side of the screen at the same time it disappears off the right side of the screen. Upon running the above code, your sprite will move across the screen, re-appearing on the left side of the screen as it goes off the right side. I encourage you to mess around with the positions in the DoEveryFrame method. See if you can get the sprite to scroll vertically or even diagonally! ","categories": ["Cocos2D"],

        "excerpt":"     RobotC is a language that one would use to program a Lego Mindstorms Robot. The kits are a bit pricey, but they offer an amazing amount of possibilities–from a simple bot that moves and turns or one that can flush your toilet or tear off toilet paper strips, to more complex designs that could potentially solve a Rubik&#8217;s Cube if one knew how to program it. That is what I&#8217;ll be showing you. Starting Off RobotC is a programming language geared towards robotics. It is primarily used with Lego Mindstorms. It is available for download at http://www.robotc.net/download/nxt/ (there is a 30 day free trial ). RobotC is only available for Windows, but it can be run on a mac with Windows virtualization /emulation software. You will also need a Lego Mindstorms kit. I recommend that you build the standard model if you’re new to this, because it’s easy to build and it will work just fine. Once you’ve downloaded RobotC on Windows, go to Programs&gt;Robotics Academy&gt;RobotC for MINDSTORMS Building License&gt;RobotC for MINDSTORMS Running Your First Program Once your robot is built, you need to plug it into your computer via the USB cable that comes with your robot. Open RobotC and go to Robot&gt;Download Firmware to download the firmware onnto the NXT device. To start I would recommend downloading a sample program onto your NXT. Go to File&gt;Open Sample Program and open Training Samples to MotorC Forward. Open it and go to Robot&gt;Compile and Download Program to load it onto your NXT. To run it, on the NXT menu, go to My Files&gt;SoftwareFiles&gt;MotorC Forward&gt;Run.

        "excerpt":"What’s A Double? Doubles are variables that have an increased storage capacity. They use up twice as much memory as a float, but our computer being the way they are, it really doesn’t make much of a difference. When performing functions such as Logarithms and Square Roots, you have to use a Double because Floats and Ints generally aren’t capable to hold that amount of data. What’s In Store? We’ll take a good look at what would be “cmath” in C++. We’ll construct the program for Square Roots, but I’ll give you the functions for changing it to compute Logarithms, Cube Roots, Powers… Code for Square Roots Here is the code you’d need for the square roots.             import java.util.Scanner;public class Double {&lt;/p&gt;                     &nbsp;                           public static void main(String[] args) {                           &nbsp;                           //Collecting the Data Here                           System.out.println(&#8220;Enter a number you&#8217;d like the square root of &#8220;);                           Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);                           double x = scan.nextDouble();                           &nbsp;                           //Actual Square Root                           double answer = java.lang.Math.sqrt(x);                           &nbsp;                           //Displaying the Answer                           System.out.print(&#8220;The Square Root of &#8221; + x + &#8221; is &#8221; + answer);                           }                           &nbsp;                           &nbsp;                           }&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;                           And here is the color code:                                                                   Doubles                                             scan.nextDouble();                                   If you have noticed, you change this function slightly depending on the data type you are using. We have seen Ints and Floats in place of the Double.                                   java.lang.Math.sqrt();                                   This function completes the mathematics function.

        "title": "JAVA Tutorial II &#8211; Data Types (Part III &#8211; Floats)",
        "excerpt":"Floats can do what Ints cannot because Ints are stupid…Just kidding. People prefer Ints because “they use less memory.” Most computers nowadays can handle all of the floats so it wouldn’t be much of a problem to outsource the Ints’ job to the floats. What’s a Float? A Float is a number than can hold a limited amount of decimal places. They are commonly declared as a Float x; or Float potatoes;. Since Java is heavily inspired by C++, Floats are declared the same way in both. What’s in Store? For this section, we are going to rebuild the Division problem. We are also going to cover the other 2 types of simple mathematics logic (subtraction and multiplication). Many of the terms learned in the Ints section will spill over into this section, such as the Scanner. We’ll learn how to implement floats and what happens when you replace ints with a float on a division problem. Part I of Part III of Java Tutorial II Create a new program and new class. You should have this down by now. After creating the new class, (we’ll name it Float), create the code as if you were making the Division Program but replace all of the Ints with Floats. Here is the code you will need for the actual program.             import java.util.Scanner;public class Float {&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;                     public static void main(String[] args) {                           &nbsp;                           System.out.print(&#8220;Enter Your Dividend&#8221;);                           Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);                           float x = scan.nextFloat();                           &nbsp;                           System.out.print(&#8220;Enter Your Divisor&#8221;);                           Scanner scan2 = new Scanner(System.in);                           float y = scan.nextFloat();                           &nbsp;                           float total=x/y;                           System.out.print(&#8220;Your Quotient is &#8221; + total);                           }                           &nbsp;                           }&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;                           And here is the color coded copy:                                                                   Here is the code                                             Float Result                                   Once you compile the program, enter numbers. If you place non-Integral numbers, notice that it gives a response including a decimal. But this decimal is limited to a certain amount of digits. If we wanted to increase the amount of digits, you&#8217;d need a data type that has a larger memory capacity.                                   Division Logic                                   To divide numbers, you just use the &#8220;/&#8221; forward slash symbol.                                   Part II of Part III of Java Tutorial II                                   We aren&#8217;t going to change the code so the result would have multiplied numbers. But when using Multiplication logic, you have to just change the forward slash (&#8220;/&#8221;) symbol into an asterisk. When creating a program that subtracts numbers, you&#8217;d change the forward slash, asterisk, or addition sign into a dash. Pretty simple huh?                                   We covered Floats and Ints, but we also covered simple mathematics and Input/Output!                                   You ready for Double?

        "title": "JAVA Tutorial II &#8211; Data Types (Part V &#8211; Char)",
        "excerpt":"What is a Char? Char is short for character, and they are interesting data types.They can only hold single values, which isn’t very useful if you are trying to hold a lot of data. But they do have their uses. If you want to create a multiple choice test, you can use chars as the values, but you are going to have to convert them from Strings. That is a complicated process which I am not inclined to explain in this tutorial. What I will explain is how to declare the value of a char. Here is the Code: So we’ll declare a simple char, and output it.             import java.util.Scanner;public class Char {public static void main(String[] args) {&lt;/p&gt;                     Scanner charscanner = new Scanner(System.in);                           &nbsp;                           char x = &#8216;a&#8217;;                           &nbsp;                           System.out.print(&#8220;The character is &#8221; + x);                           &nbsp;                           &nbsp;                           }                           &nbsp;                           }&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;                           This is pretty self-explanatory. But the only difference, is in order to declare a char, you need to use only a single character like a period or the letter &#8220;a.&#8221;                                   So this is how you use a Char in Java                                   &lt;&lt; Return to Double          ","categories": ["JAVA","Tutorials"],

        "title": "JAVA Tutorial II &#8211; Data Types (Part II &#8211; Integers)",
        "excerpt":"In this tutorial, we’ll create simple programs using Eclipse that compute solid numbers. We’ll create a program the divides 2 numbers and a program that adds 2 numbers. What’s an Integer? An integer is a number that can be expressed as either a negative or a positive value, but can never be a decimal value. For instance, 3.4 is not an integer, but -122 is an integer. Ex) 4/2 = 2. The program will respond with a 2. Ex) 4/3 = 1.33333… The program will respond with a 1 instead of the expected/correct answer of 1.33333 . Why? Because you specified the number to be an Integer, not a Float or Double. Setting Up the Project I’m assuming you are familiar with setting up a standard Java Program in Eclipse. But in case it slipped your memory here are the steps:       Go to File &gt; New &gt; Java Project         Label the project “Integer”         Go to File &gt; New &gt; Class         Click Browse adjacent to source and select “Integer” as the Source folder         Label the class “Integer”   Congratulations! Part I of Part II of Java Tutorial II So we’ll start with observing the adding of integers in a Java program. Here is the code you’ll need:             import java.util.Scanner;public class Integer {public static void main(String [] args) { &lt;/p&gt;                     System.out.print(&#8220;Enter Your First Number&#8221;);                           Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);                           int x = scan.nextInt();                           System.out.print(&#8220;Enter Your Second Number&#8221;);                           Scanner scan2 = new Scanner(System.in);                           int y = scan2.nextInt();                           int total = x+y;                           System.out.print(&#8220;The Sum of the Two Numbers is &#8221; + total);                           }                           }&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;                           If you want to look at a colored example as the text may help you see the code better, here is a screenshot of the code.                                                                   Here is the Code                                             import java.util.Scanner;                                   There are 2 major ways of allowing the user to input data. You can use BufferedReader (which we will eventually cover) or Scanner. Scanner is much easier to use and for our learning sake, we&#8217;ll use it. But in order to use the Scanner, you have to import it first. import java.util.Scanner; is the piece of code you use.                                   So when you use the scanner, you do the following:                                   1. Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in); //System.in means you are going to input data. &#8220;scan&#8221; after Scanner is like a new instance of it. That&#8217;s why during the second block of code, you use &#8220;scan2&#8221; because scan is already in use.                                   2. int x = scan.nextInt(); //You declare the integer you are using here and you MUST put the &#8220;scan&#8221; that you are going to scan with. This is very vague isn&#8217;t it? Well, you can figure this part out if my explanation was too obscure (chances are it was)                                   Declaring Ints                                   You can declare an integer anywhere by placing the int next to a name followed by a semi-colon. But in this case, it has to be declared at a certain point. And that certain point is directly after you declare the Scanner.                                   Addition Logic                                   When adding 2 numbers, you have to come up with the resulting integer. &#8220;Int total = x+y;&#8221; was the code to use.                                                                   Example of the Console's Building of the Application                                             Part II of Part II of Java Tutorial II                                   Now we are going to look at division. Not because division is cool or difficult or starts with a &#8220;d.&#8221; Division requires a float to be as the quotient of the problem because most division problems result with a non-integral number. But since this is an Integer tutorial, we are going to not use float just because we are rebels.                                   Creating the Program                                   You do not need to create a new class or anything. Just stick with what you already have. All you have to do is change the section where it says &#8220;int total = x+y&#8221; to &#8220;int total = x/y.&#8221; Then you can change all of the System.out.print to (&#8220;Enter the Dividend&#8221;) and to (&#8220;Enter the Divisor&#8221;). Then you can change the System.out.print that says (&#8220;The Sum of the Two Numbers is&#8221; + total); to (&#8220;The Quotient of the Two Numbers is&#8221; + total);                                   Here is what the code should look like in the program:                                                                   Notice the changes in the System.out.print and the Math Logic                                             So let&#8217;s compile this program and launch it. If you enter numbers that would normally result in a decimal, it&#8217;ll round down. Always. So you should replace the &#8220;Int&#8221; before &#8220;total&#8221; with a &#8220;Float.&#8221;                                                                   Just What I thought. 4 divided by 3 equals 0. I'll ace AP Division for sure.                                             So, you are now a master of inputting floats and such. Congratulations.

        "title": "How the World is against Productivity [Part 1]",
        "excerpt":" UPDATE: Part 2 is up! I’m stepping out of line here a bit and not just posting a ‘how-to’ or a roundup or something of the like. My first post’s more of a criticism… I tried to keep it to things I could prove, but a little bias may have slipped in here and there. My apologies for those. Productivity is defined as how much anyone can make in a certain amount of time. Many factors go into this, such as how well you can concentrate, how fast you can type, and how many mouse clicks are required to navigate. For the sake of organization, I’m splitting it up by hardware and software (Parts 1 and 2 respectively). Part 1 – Hardware Hardware consists of the parts of the computer we can physically touch, like the keyboard, the RAM (if so desired), hard drive, screen et cetera. You may not have thought of it before, but those really affect how well we can get something done. How easy would it be to type 20 pages on a keyboard that’s half the size of normal one? Not very. People that work with large excel files, web pages, or other long documents benefit from having larger screens with higher vertical resolution, so they don’t have to scroll as much. Resolution is perhaps one of the most important characteristics of a computer. Most people may not have noticed, but over the last few years there has been a shift in formats for screens. Screens used to be in the 4:3 format. This means that for every 4 pixels that there were horizontally, 3 had to exist vertically. Resolutions such as 1024×768 were common on smaller screens. Programmers, for example, loved these screens because they could see many lines of code at once on large screens). Code generally tends to be many short lines rather than few long ones.  Then the shift to 16:10 panels happened, because it was cheaper to produce those (do the math on the area, when you keep the diagonal length the same). I actually like this format the best out of all of them. It is just wide enough to let you fit two documents side by side, and had a decent compromise on how much of something was visible vertically. Sadly, the PC industry decided to follow the trend of the TV’s, and made a further switch to 16:9, the standard we have now. On smaller screens, 1366 × 768 is common, versus the 1280 x 800 before. It’s a nightmare that most comsumers happily won’t notice. The problem isn’t necessarily that the resolutions are lower now. It’s that once you try to get the same number of vertical pixels onto that format, the pixel density is unusably high, or the screen much larger. For most people the icons and text would be a strain to see. To give an example, in the 16:10 format, 1440×900 pixels were fairly common on 13-14? laptops. Now however, with the 16:9 standard, the only way to get the same number of vertical pixels is to use 1600×900. This is not common on 13-14? laptops at all, because the area is smaller, and there are more pixels. Not to mention it’s probably more expensive to produce that pixel density. By the way: the pictures here are of the Toshiba portege r200, r500, and r835 respectively. Did anyone notice that the last iteration of the laptop has a larger screen (diagonal length) and less vertical room than the r500? One other thing to note is that there has also been a general switch to glossy screens over matte ones. While this results in more vibrant colors and better video playback, it reduces viewing angles and doesn’t allow you to focus in an area with lots of light. The only other hardware things we directly interact with a lot are the keyboard and mouse, which I can hardly say got worse (Good thing!) ","categories": ["Uncategorized"],

        "title": "MOG Goes Free, Rdio To Follow",
        "excerpt":"We’re big fans of streaming music websites, as you could probably tell from our post about 5 great online music streaming services. We’re even bigger fans of free services. Needless to say, we were really excited when we heard that premium streaming music services MOG and Rdio were going freemium.  MOG  was founded in 2005 with  a music based social network in mind. Until now, users would be required to pay a monthly fee to access MOG’s 12 million track music library. With a top tier subscription plan, users can access MOG from almost any of their devices. Similar to outrageously popular Pandora, MOG features a well made radio function that plays music that is similar to other music users enjoy. As is the norm with premium music services, music can be saved onto your devices for offline listening.  Rdio is quite a bit younger than MOG, launching about this time last year. It was created by the founders of Skype, which tells you something about the quality and innovation you can expect from it. Rdio is a subscription based music service. Clients are available for it on most popular devices, but a top tier plan is required to access Rdio outside of your web browser. Like MOG, Rdio has social networking features. Unsurprisingly, they are somewhat less developed. With the “Unlimited” plan, music can be saved for offline listening. Most generic music service features, such as a radio (which is actually quite good), have been incorporated into Rdio. It is obviously not a sustainable business model to offer free music and services without getting anything in return. MOG is ad-supported, and music is “earned” through site activity and user referrals. Rdio, on the other hand, will be presented without ads to free users. They hope to make money by convincing people to pay for their premium services. MOG has already rolled out its free service, and Rdio will be doing so “soon.” It is likely that MOG and Rdio are changing business models due to the release of Spotify in the United States. Spotify poses as serious competition with it’s completely free music service, and its launch kicked of a small revolution in the music industry. One key difference between Spotify’s free plan and those of MOG and Rdio is that Spotify has a set limit on number of songs that can be listened to per month, while MOG and Rdio haven’t announced any limit. This might mean they intend to offer less music, or perhaps that they just want to be able to change limits easily and without complaint. ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Hot News","Music"],

It shows the indentations required by the Interpreter to make the program work. In the future, if you use an IDE to write the program, the indentations will be automatically provided for you. Hello, World! This will be the shortest Hello, World! yet. In Terminal or Command Prompt, open up the Python interface. Then type the following: print “Hello, World!” And then hit enter. If you did everything correctly, it should look like this:           !!!   And now you are done! Print All the Print command does is print out whatever you put in the quotations. This is pretty self-explanatory. So if you want to make any other Python programs where all you do is print stuff, now you know how to!

        "title": "Google+ Goes Public, Rolls Out Cool New Hangout Features",
        "excerpt":"   Google+ has been available for over 90 days, but until now signing up required an invitation. During the first couple weeks, invitations were a little hard to come by because Google locked down invitations shortly after launching Google+. Eventually, Google offered every user 50 invitations to hand out, and the user base skyrocketed to over 20 million. To put this into perspective, Facebook has over 800 million users, and Twitter has over 100 million. Starting this week, anyone with a  Google account will be able to create a Google+ account. Well, almost everybody. Since Google+ has been so successful as a private service, I expect many more millions of users to join the young social network. The real question, the one that has Mark Zuckerberg, Dick Costolo, and Larry Page holding their breaths, is just how many more. Will it surpass the popularity of Facebook and Twitter? Will it become the hottest social network on the world wide web? This episode doesn’t have a fast-forward option, so we’ll just have to sit back and watch the show. Some of the reasons that Google+ has potential include such unique features as Circles and Google Hangouts. Circles enables users to categorize their friends and share content with only certain categories of friends. This simulates the social relationships that people have in their everyday lives. Google Hangouts takes group video chat to a  whole new level. Not limited by the 2 participant video calls that Facebook offers, Google+ users can quickly create a hangout with people from their Circles. And, as I’m about to describe, a whole lot more. Immediately following the public launch of Google+, some fantastic new features for Hangouts started rolling out. Namely, Google Docs collaboration, screen sharing, SketchUp collaboration, and a Hangouts API for developers. That’s right, web developers are now able to integrate Hangouts with their websites. When you’re participating in a Hangout, you can open one of your existing Google Docs or create a new one. The Google Docs editor will appear right next to the videos of Hangout participants, and all active video call participants will be able to edit the document. This introduces a new level of online document collaboration! Services like Zoho and Etherpad provided a great collaborative document editing service, but they lacked voice and video chat. Plus, their document editing software isn’t quite as capable as Google Docs. On an interesting note, Google bought Etherpad a year or so ago.    Screen sharing is pretty self explanatory, Hangout participants can share either a portion of their screen or their entire screen. I can see this being great for gaming, meetings, tech support, and presentations. When I saw SketchUp on the list of new features, I nearly wet myself. I thought it was referring to  Google’s amazing 3D modeling software. As it turns out, this SketchUp is actually just a diagram and simple drawing editor. Everyone in the Hangout can contribute to a diagram or drawing once a new or previously saved sketch has been loaded. What’s that? You don’t have a Google+ account yet? Well you can hop on the bandwagon at https://plus.google.com/ . Alternatively, click on the big blue arrow that is currently on Google’s home page.

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy S II Review",
        "excerpt":" The Samsung Galaxy S 2 is one of the new phones from Samsung. The Galaxy is, in my opinion, the best android phone on the market. It weighs  a mere 4.6 ounces and is 5.11” x 2.74” x .38”. On the outside, the Galaxy only has a micro USB port, a headphone jack, volume control buttons, and the power button. The display on the Galaxy is 800 x 480 pixels. Like most phones made by Samsung the Galaxy has a “Super Amoled Plus” screen, which gives richer color and better detail that you won’t find on any other smart phone (except maybe the iPhone 4, but that’s debatable). The Galaxy also sports a 4.52 inch screen that is perfect for watching movies on the go. The Galaxy is running Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread. You can get the Galaxy with a 16 GB internal memory and a 32 GB external memory. It has an 8.0 megapixel camera on the back, and a 2.0 megapixel camera on the front, but that’s really the norm for all android devices. The Galaxy has a 4x digital optical zoom and many camera effects such as cartoon, action, etc. It is also able to take HD video in 1920 x 1080, which is a nice upgrade from most smart phones which shoot in 720p. Samsung claims that it has a battery life of about 10.5 days and 8.7 hours with continued talk, but if you want to make your battery life last this long or longer you can turn off all unnecessary functions in the phone, like Bluetooth and wifi, when you’re not using it. Doing this will make your battery last as long as you need (probably). Being a new phone to enter the market, the Galaxy impresses me with a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor. To be specific, the Galaxy’s processor is a C210 dual-core processor with 1GB of ram. This is a great phone for going on the internet because of its 4G and dual core processor, but the Galaxy’s only carrier is Sprint. Sadly, Sprint does not cover America with 4G as much as Verizon, but if you do have Sprint and you live in an area with 4G, the speed of the phone over the internet would be incredible. There is an alternative to getting the Galaxy on Sprint; you can wait until the Galaxy gets put on T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. In this review we have covered almost everything you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S II. I believe that this phone is not only the best android phone on the market, but also the best smart phone on the market. If I were to give this phone a rating out of 10 I would have to give it a 9 out of 10. I think that it would be difficult to find anyone unhappy with the Galaxy S II phone.

        "title": "New Facebook Profile Layout Announced At The F8 Facebook Developer Conference",
        "excerpt":" This Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced drastic changes to Facebook user profiles at the company’s annual F8 developer conference in San Francisco. While over 100,000 users gazed at the live video stream, Zuckerberg showed off the elegant new design that will change the face of modern social networking. Until now, all major social networks had one goal. They were designed to answer the question “What’s up?” According to the experts, that’s not enough. Timeline, the accurately named profile layout that was announced, changes this ideal to include not only what people have been up to in the past 15 minutes, but also their entire life. Facebook has only been around since 2004, so it would seem that user history could only go back that far. However, users will now be able to share media and stories that are from any time in their lives to any time in their lives. Content from different time periods of a person’s life then then be called upon and will be displayed in a large, neatly designed page.  User content is displayed in one of three sections: cover, stories, and apps. Both the stories and apps sections are made up of widget-like boxes that originate from the vertical line in the center of the page, the timeline. Profile covers consist of a large image banner of the user’s choice. Below that is basic information like name, relationships, and location. In the current Profile layouts, users have one image that serves as their profile image. It is displayed on the top right-hand corner of their page as well as their posts. It acts a as a site-wide avatar. This profile picture is still there, it’s just smaller less conspicuous. The second main section of a profile is the stories section. In it, status updates, photos, friends, Likes, and places are displayed. The stories section essentially includes all of the things the current Facebook layout has to offer. It is where you tell your story, both past and present. The last section of Timeline profiles is an application activity aggregator of sorts. A multitude of applications, like Spotify and Netflix, will be able to connect to Facebook accounts and share activity, like recently listened to songs, in real time. That’s right, you don’t even have to press a “Like” button anymore. This could be the killer feature. Although I am going to walk you through a sneaky method that will enable Timeline for you within a couple of minutes, you can check out this page to get a good idea of what the new layouts will look like. As is to be expected, the Facebook iPhone app will also receive a major UI change. It will resemble the web version, but it will be condensed to fit on the smaller screen.      Okay, you&#8217;re all revved up and ready to try out the new UI. While it will be rolled out to the general public over the next couple of months, developers are being sent automated invites to try it out. Here&#8217;s what you can do to become a developer and try out Timeline:   Log into Facebook if you haven’t already done so  Go here and allow the Facebook developer app to access your account information  Create a new app  Give any random app name and namespace  Verify that you’re not a robot  If all is going well, you should be in the Facebook developers page. Click on the “Open Graph” tab on the left side of the page  Fill in anything in the “Get Started With Open Graph” text fields and click “Get Started”  In the screen that follows, simply click the “Save Changes and Next” button at the bottom of the screen  Repeat step 8 for the next screen  You should be in the Apps -&gt; (app name) -&gt; Open Graph page  That’s it, you’re done. Wait a couple of minutes and then check back on your Facebook homescreen. There should be an invite to Timeline!In summary, “It’s the heart of your Facebook experience, completely re-thought from the ground up,” (Mark Zuckerberg). There is sure to be backlash to this update, as there has been with every update. Once people become accustomed to a certain layout, they don’t like change. Are you an avid Facebook user? If so, comment and tell us what you think of Timeline! ","categories": ["Hot News","Social Networking"],

        "title": "How The World Is Against Productivity [Part 2]",
        "excerpt":"Part 2! (see here for Part 1:Hardware) I recently upgraded my Windows XP to Windows 7. The first thing I noticed was that everything just looked, well, nicer. After using it a few times though, I noticed that it had followed Apple’s trend toward being less usable (for serious work).           Which one is active? - fairly obvious... right?   In XP, the active window was ALWAYS very distinguishable, being a bold, dark shade of blue that one could find in an instant. The inactive windows were a light, grayish blue. In OSX, and windows 7, The active window borders and inactive ones are almost the same shade! How are my eyes supposed to instantly snap toward the active window??? I have to waste my time scanning my open windows to find the one I want. I guess I can only hope they bring back the higher contrast scheme eventually…           Tiger: Which one's active? The chat window? The one right in the middle? The one with the drop down menu? Oh wait, there are two of those :(     Also, while OSX’s tiling is quite ‘suave’ (Spanish for “cool”), it takes too long to find the window you want if you have more than 6 open. In windows 7, I have to hover my house over the application on the bottom, wait for the little popup, then proceed to look at which I want. In XP I could just quickly scan the bottom bar to read the start of the title and jump straight there. It skips the extra button press for tiling or the extra delay of waiting for the popup.           Ubuntu: Ridiculous -- looks cool though!   My favorite operating system, Ubuntu, also follows this trend toward pretty pictures. With the the switch to Unity desktop or Gnome shell, they adopt a mac style dock and get rid of the old XP-like bar on the bottom (I immediately downgraded to the older version of Ubuntu). They also added extra clicks to get around, like opening an application by first going through the applications menu. I hope I can just add a launcher to the top (or something like that) when I’m forced to switch later on. UPDATE: Has anyone noticed google’s new theme? It’s doing the exact same thing! C’mon people… shades of gray aren’t going to help us out… One thing I hope we can always rely on are keyboard shortcuts. The only problem with them being that they have  a learning curve, though most people can easily get the hang of the general-usage shortcuts.   Who can tell which are the active windows here?

        "title": "YouTube Converting 2D Videos To 3D, And No More Video Time Limit For Verified Users",
        "excerpt":"   YouTube has recently started rolling out a Beta version of their 2D to 3D conversion program that, well, converts your 2D videos to 3D videos. They were led to do this by the great popularity of 3D televisions and related gear in the past year. Being the leading internet video publishing platform, they felt that it was their duty to bring modern video technology to the world wide web. Also, they realized that only a tiny portion of the population possessed dual lens cameras capable of capturing 3D footage. A couple of YouTube developers have been fiddling around with supporting 3D video for years, but few people made use of their projects. There must be some pretty intense algorithms behind this process! Apparently, their conversion tool evaluates the color and motion of a video in order to simulate a 3D video. Oh, and in case the picture I included above didn’t tip you off, you will still need to wear those dorky red-blue glasses to see the third dimension of converted videos. As if that amazing feature weren’t cool enough, all verified  YouTube users can now upload videos longer than 15 minutes. By verified, I mean users who have shared their phone number with Google and received a text message containing a secret code. Also, users must not have an account with videos that have been flagged and taken down. Prior to this announcement, users had to either be a YouTube partner or have a popular channel to upload videos longer than 15 minutes. ","categories": ["Google","Video"],

        "excerpt":"     Now that you&#8217;ve got the basics for the Lego Mindstorms, we can start programming. To start, open up RobotC and open a new file. Outputting text is the first thing you will do with almost any programming language, so let&#8217;s start with a program that displays &#8220;Hello World&#8221; on the screen. Note that this program will not be very useful in actual programming, but I&#8217;m doing this to demonstrate that RobotC can display &#8220;Hello World&#8221;.             task main() //the start of all RobotC programs            {  // the start of the function            eraseDisplay();      //clear the NXT display            // now to display \"Hello World\"            nxtDisplayCenteredBigTextLine(2, \"Hello\");            nxtDisplayCenteredBigTextLine(4, \"World!\");            while (true);            //loop until program is terminated (so we can read the display)            }  //the end of the function        This is what it will look like. Don’t worry about the commands, for they are not used much in RobotC.     Now that we have that out of the way, we can start with the actual programming. Let&#8217;s start with a basic program that tells you robot to move forward and backward.             task main()  //this is the starting for all RobotC program            {  //the start of the function            motor[motorB] = 50;  //tells the robot's B motor to go forward at 50 power            motor[motorC] = 50;  //tells the robot's C motor to go forward at 50 power            wait1Msec(1000);  //runs previous tasks for 1000 milliseconds, or 1 second            motor[motorB] = -40;  //tells the robot's B motor to go backward at 40 power            motor[motorC] = -40;  //tells the robot's C motor to go backward at 40 power            wait1Msec(2000);  //runs previous tasks for 2000 milliseconds, or 2 second            }  //the end of the function            This program makes the robot move forward at 50% power for 1 second,and then move backwards at 40% power for 2 seconds. For the power, I would advise that you dont run the power at 100 because the robot has a PID control that speeds up or slows down to get the desired speed. having the motor at 100 power will not allow the PID control to speed up the motor to get the desired speed. No need to understand that now, I will explain it more in a different tutorial.           So, positive values make the robot go forward, and negative values make the robot go backwards. How do I make it turn?           There are two simple ways to turn your robot. There are other ways, but that&#8217;ll come later. This is another simple program demonstrating them.                         task Main{                motor[motorB] = 50;                motor[motorC] = -50;                wait1Msec(400);                motor[motorB] = 0;                motor[motorC] = 50;                wait1Msec(800);                }                          First, this program tells the robot to turn on a dime to the left (assuming the B motor is the right one) for .4 seconds. It then tells the robot to turn in an arc for .8 seconds. That&#8217;s all for now, I&#8217;ll see you next time when I&#8217;m explaining functions!       ","categories": ["RobotC"],

        "title": "Apple Event To Be Held On October 4th",
        "excerpt":" Ever since the iPhone 4 was released, Apple fanboys have been shouting next generation iPhone speculations from the rooftops. On Tuesday, October 4th, Apple will remove all mystery relating to the next generation of iPhones at its “Let’s Talk iPhone” event. The event is strictly invitation-only, so only VIPs and big name media organizations will be able to attend. In addition to a new iPhone, Apple will probably release iOS 5 publicly. It has been available to developers for some time now, so the features that it brings won’t come as a surprise. In addition, the line of iPod Touch’s might be updated with such features as 3G data subscriptions (like the 3G model of iPad) and, of course, iOS 5. Apple has tight lips, and barely any information regarding their projects and announcements makes its way to the public. If the rumors hold true, and the iPhone 5 is in fact announced on Tuesday, then the iPhone 5 will have 1GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel camera, an Apple A5 processor, availability on the Sprint network, advanced voice control technology (think Android), and dual mode CDMA/GSM capability. It is also possible that the iPhone 5 will sport a larger screen (probably 4 inches). This will be the first media event held since the resignation of Steve jobs, so Tim Cook, the new CEO, will preside at the event. There are currently over 110 million iPhone users around world, and most of them aren’t eager to ditch their beloved iPhones for a newer model. It remains to be seen just how many will. Even if people continue to use older models of the iPhone, most will be able to update to iOS 5 and thus experience the rich, new OS features. If you are one of the people considering getting a new iPhone, and you currently have an older model, then you might consider wiping the data off of it and selling it on eBay or Craigslist in order to make reduce the out-of-pocket cost of the upgrade.

        "title": "PHP Tutorial 4 &#8211; Basic Math Operators",
        "excerpt":" In our last tutorial, we discussed variables and comments in PHP. Today, we are going to go over basic math operators. By math operators, I mean symbols that represent math operations. Adding, subtracting, dividing, and multiplying are all examples of math operators. There are seven main operators in PHP, and they can be seen in the following table:             Operation                  Operator (Symbol Used To Perform The Operation)                    Addition                  +                    Subtraction                  &#8211;                    Multiplication                  *                    Division                  /                    Remainder / Modulus                  %                    Increase By 1 / Increment                  ++                    Decrease By 1 / Decrement                  &#8212;      Let’s put the first five basic math operations to use in a short program:             &lt; ?phpecho (6 + 4).\"\";echo (6 - 4).\"\";echo (6 * 4).\"\";echo (6 / 4).\"\";echo (6 % 4).\"\";?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  When compiled, the above code will output the following to the screen:                   10      2      24      1.5      2                echo (6 + 4).&#8221;&#8221;;   Every line of PHP code in this program was almost the same, so let&#8217;s take a look at this one. We outputted the sum of six and four to the screen. Notice the lack of quotation marks, this isn&#8217;t a string. We also concatenated an HTML line break tag onto the end of our echo function. Without a line break, all of the numbers would be squished together on one line. If we were working with a strictly PHP page, then we could simply output &#8220;\\n&#8221; to get the same effect. However, since our PHP code is within an HTML page, we must adhere to HTML syntax when outputting anything to the page.   We can also use mathematical operators in variable definitions.                   &lt; ?php$adding = 6 + 4;$subtracting = 6 - 4;$multiplying = 6 * 4;$dividing = 6 / 4;$modulus = 6 % 4;echo $adding.\"\";echo $subtracting.\"\";echo $multiplying.\"\";echo $dividing.\"\";echo $modulus.\"\";?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  This code will output the same thing as the previous chunk of code, but it uses a different method. First, it sets four variables equal to one of 5 basic math operations. Then, it outputs the values of the variables (along with a line break tag). Notice how there aren&#8217;t any quotation marks around the operations in the variable declarations; only strings need quotation marks.   When declaring variables, we aren&#8217;t limited to only using numbers in operations. We can also perform math operations with variables.                   &lt; ?php$six = 6;$four = 4;$subtracting = $six - $four;echo $adding;?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  The above code will output &#8220;2&#8221;.   $subtracting = $six &#8211; $four;   In this line, we set the variable &#8220;subtracting&#8221; equal to the value that results from subtracting the value of the variable &#8220;four&#8221; from the value of the variable &#8220;six&#8221;. Once the values of $six and $four have been retrieved, the line looks like &#8220;$subtracting = 6 &#8211; 4;&#8221;. In the line &#8220;echo $subtracting;&#8221;, we go on to output the value of $subtracting.   PHP doesn&#8217;t limit you to simple operations; you can perform many operations at once.                   &lt; ?php$operations = 6 * 2 + 4 /2 - 7;echo $operations;?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  The above code will output &#8220;7&#8221;.   As you can see, we set a variable equal to a complex expression. Way back in your first years of school, you were  taught a process called &#8220;PEMDAS&#8221;. That is, different operations occur before others when simplifying an expression, equality, or even an inequality. PHP follows these basic math rules as well, so make sure you know the order of operations.      As you can see, the first thing that happens when simplifying operations is that operations in parenthesis are simplified first. Therefore, if you want an operation to occur first, put it in parenthesis.   It&#8217;s annoying to type &#8220;$variable = $variable + 1&#8221; so most programming languages have things called increment and decrement operators. PHP is no exception, so you can easily increase and decrease the values of variables by 1.                    &lt; ?php$increment = 5;$decrement = 8;$increment++;$decrement--;echo $increment.\"\";echo $decrement.\"\";?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;  The above code will output:                   6&lt;/p&gt;                          7&lt;/td&gt;        &lt;/tr&gt;        &lt;/tbody&gt;        &lt;/table&gt;                                  $increment++;                                           This is simply equivalent to  the operation &#8220;$increment = $increment + 1;&#8221;.                                            $decrement++;                                           This is simply equivalent to the operation &#8220;$decrement = $decrement &#8211; 1;&#8221;                                           Sadly, our tutorial is coming to an end.

        "title": "iPhone 4S And More Announced At The Let&#8217;s Talk iPhone Event, Leaves Followers Disappointed",
        "excerpt":" Apple held its “Let’s Talk iPhone” event this Tuesday at its headquarters in Cupertino. As was expected, the keynote was presented by Apple’s new CEO, Tim Cook. Steve Jobs resigned rather recently, making this the first Apple keynote presentation at which Cook presided. Jobs was nowhere to be seen during the event, but, as we found out on Wednesday, there was a good reason for that. The entire presentation was about an hour and a half, and you can view the official recording below this paragraph. If you’re like most people, you probably don’t have the better part of two hours to just sit around and watch a keynote presentation. You need not worry, though, for in this post I intend to present and analyze most of the information revealed during the keynote.  Cook starts off talking about the rapid growth of Apple and that two new stores opened in China last weekend. He goes on to explain the impressive popularity of their stores, and even plays a video of the launch day of one. This brings the total number of Apple stores to 357 (in 11 countries). He continues with tails of triumph regarding Mac OS X Lion and the astoundingly light Macbook Air. Apparently, customers are just gobbling up these new Apple products and the Apple market share is now 23 percent. After providing a quick summary of music history and the iPod, he points out how music is a major part of our lives nowadays because devices like the iPod make it convenient to listen to music anywhere at anytime. Cook also shared out some unsurprising statistics:   The iPod market share is above 70 percent in the portable music player market  Over 300 million iPods have been sold to date  The iPod is the most popular portable music player  Over 45 million iPods have been sold in the last year, and half of them are buying iPods for the first timeOf course, he couldn’t mention the iPod without bragging about iTunes. The number of song on iTunes is now 100 times what it was at launch. Plus, 16 billion songs have been downloaded to date. As I’m sure we all could have guessed, this makes iTunes the number one music store in the world (it’s kind of odd to give a virtual store that kind of title). Tim Cook finally started talking about iPhones, but it was only a teaser. He stated some obvious facts, like it being the number 1 smart phone in the world, and some less obvious facts, like it being number one in mobile phone customer satisfaction. However, it only has a 5 percent market share in the worldwide mobile phone market. Oh, and “More coming up and iPhone.”  On to the iPad. People are thoroughly enjoying the iPad line, both the first and second generation. The customer satisfaction rating is above 95 percent, and iPads are making their way into schools across the country. Cook clearly believes that the iPad has the potential to change the way children learn in schools. Impressively, every state in the United States has a pilot program going on in which thousands of schools provide iPads to students to supplement their learning material and activities. Cook described how iPads are making their way to cockpits, hospitals, and similar working environments. While he says that this makes jobs more efficient and safe, I can imagine many situations in which it could be hazardous. Old paper and pencil organization, storage, and referencing is extremely reliable, while advanced technology can easily break or run out of power. The iPad is dominating the tablet market, at 74 percent market share. As is true with all of Apple’s mobile devices, the iPad runs on iOS. Cook produced an amazing statistic: over 250 million iOS devices have been sold to date. Due to the great popularity of Apple’s mobile devices, 43 percent of mobile devices now run on iOS. One of the reasons that people love iOS is that there are over 500,000 million apps available on the App Store. In case you haven’t noticed, there are apps for almost everything on there. While on the subject of iOS, a new Apple app for iOS was announced. The new app is Cards, and it allows you to easily make cards. There are 21 different card designs in six different categories. Once you are done creating your card, Apple will print and mail it for you for a fair $2.99 (to anywhere in the U.S.) or $4.99 (to anywhere outside of the U.S.). Once iOS 5 is released, Cards users will receive a push notification when their card is delivered.  Scott Forstall, the senior vice president of iOS Software, took the stage to do a quick recap on the major new features the iOS 5 will introduce. iOS 5 was introduced earlier this year, at the WWDC of 2011. If you would like to read about the top ten new features the iOS 5 brings, check out my post about the announcements at the WWDC. iCloud was also re-explained. With iCloud, the music that you purchase will appear automatically on all of your devices. You will also be able to download past iTunes and App Store purchases.  In addition, media (books, photos, videos, et cetera) and iWork projects not purchased from iTunes or the App Store will also be automatically synced between all of your devices. Many people have large music libraries, and uploading them to iCloud isn’t practical. Apple has a solution for this. When you “upload” songs to iCloud, iTunes will actually be matching your songs to songs in Apple’s massive music library. Like uploading, downloading can take a long time. Plus, large music libraries can take up a lot of space on mobile devices. In the iTunes settings of iOS devices, “iTunes Match” can be turned on and your entire music library can be streamed to your device. Another cool iCloud feature is Backup. iCloud will backup all of your iDevice data daily. As a bonus, you can easily apply backups to new devices. Find my iPhone has been around for a while. With it, users can see the locations of all of their iDevices on a map. Some new features were announced, though. Macs will soon be compatible with Find my iPhone, and there will be a new iOS app for accessing the Find my iPhone data of friends and family. This new app, Find My Friends, will show a list of all of your family and friends and where they currently are located. Of course, users will have to opt-in to share their location. You can also look at a large map that will show the exact locations of all of your friends. I find it difficult to imagine that your friends would want you stalking their location 24/7, and it seems like the Find My Friends devlopers thought similarly. You can create Find My Friends events that will limit the period of time during which event members will be able to see each other’s location. Apple has created this video to summarize the features that iCloud will bring:  As was expected, some minor updates to the line of iPods were made. The iPad Nano now has a better navigations system. Mimicking the page interface of iOS devices, you will be able to scroll through your basic iPod Nano applications. Additionally, the Fitness app has been improved. Users can now go on a walk or run with their iPod Nano and then connect their iPod to their computer to upload their run information to the Nike Plus website. Apple noticed that people were using iPod Nanos as watches, so they improved the app accordingly. There are 16 new clock faces, including a retro and Mickey Mouse styles.  iPod Touches were left relatively untouched, with the only update being that they are now available in white. At long last, the iPhone 4S was announced. It wasn’t what we expected. It seemed fairly obvious that the iPhone 5 was going to be released, what with that being the past release trend and iOS 5 being released next week. The iPhone 4S looks almost identical to the iPhone 4. Most of the new features have to do with he internal hardware. Below are the new features introduced in the iPhone 4S:   A5 chip that will make the iPhone run twice as fast. Plus, graphics will be up to 7 times as fast.  Improved battery life: 8 hours of 2G talk time, 14 hours of 2G talk time, 6 hours of 3G browsing, 9 hours of Wi-Fi browsing, 10 hours of video, or 40 hours of music  Switches between antennas for transmitting and receiving  Download speed is twice as fast  CDMA and GSM capabilities  8 megapixel camera (you can now take photos that are 3264 by 2448 pixels)  33 percent faster camera capture  Backside illumination sensor in camera that allows for 73 percent more light to be collected  1080p HD video recording  Face detection  Real time video stabilization  Airplay improvements such as screen mirroring  Siri voice recognition  Siri will do an excellent job of recognizing commands in no particular format. It can perform a wide range of tasks, like sending a text message or getting directions. The new features can best be described through this video:  It really is rather incredible. Android phones have had voice recognition capability for some time, but it was certainly not as good as Siri. Overall, the iPhone 4S was a good improvement on the iPhone. There is no reason to be frustrated that the iPhone 5 wasn’t announced- Apple could easily have called this phone the iPhone 5. Here is the official Apple video demonstrating the iPhone 4S:   ","categories": ["Apple","Hot News","iOS"],

        "title": "Steve Jobs Passes Away at 56, Leaves The World A Little Less &#8220;Insanely Great&#8221;",
        "excerpt":"   Technology design genius Steve Jobs passed away this Wednesday as an inevitable result of his fight with a rare form of pancreatic cancer. He had only reached the age of 56, having been born in 1955. Through his creative thinking, he managed to revolutionize the technology industry. His inventions didn’t merely improve existing technology, but drastically changed it. He left behind brilliant new ideas and designs that will be a part of human culture for many generations to come. His passing was announced on October 5, 2011 by Apple’s Board of Directors, having nothing more to say than “We are deeply saddened to announce that Steve Jobs passed away today. Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.” Additionally, the front page of Apple.com has been changed to commemorate the life of Jobs. It appropriately links to Jobs’ new Apple.com page, in which a single quote on Jobs’ death resides:  Jobs had been battling pancreatic cancer since 2004. After announcing his diagnosis to his employees, he got treatment for his cancer and appeared to be well again. During his leave, sales and operation leader Tim Cook stood in for Jobs. When Jobs delivered his keynote at the WWDC’s of 2006 and 2008, he appeared in bad health.  Later that year, when the internet and the media were buzzing with speculation regarding Jobs’ health, he presented a slide stating “The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.” In quoting Mark Twain at the Let’s Rock keynote, he responded somewhat positively about his health.  Steve made his last public appearance in front of Cupertino City Council back in June, where he pitched the construction plans of a new space ship like campus for Apple. He appears in fair health, and he leaves us in amazement. Amazement at a wonderful man that knew that he was probably living the last year of his life, yet was still greatly involved in planning for the future of Apple.  Several months ago, in late August, Jobs resigned as the CEO of Apple because he thought his health had worsened to the point where he could no longer perform his duties as the leader of Apple. Let’s take a moment to look back at the incredible life and career of Steven Paul Jobs.   In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer after having great success building Apples in Jobs’ garage.  In 1984, Jobs presented the Macintosh 128k personal computer. The famous Apple Macintosh “1984” commercial plays during the Super Bowl XVIII.  In 1985, Jobs was forced to resign from his position at Apple due to conflict with other executives.  Following his resignation, he started NeXT Software.  In 1986, Jobs bought Pixar Animation Studios.  In 1995 “Toy Story” was released by Pixar and Disney. It was a huge success and it made Jobs a billionaire.  In 1996, Jobs sold NeXT to Apple for more than $400 million. He was rehired by Apple.  In 1997, Jobs became the interim CEO of Apple.  In 1998, the iMac is released. It became the fastest-selling PC in history.  In 2000, Jobs became the permanent CEO of Apple and he introduced Mac OS X.  In 2001, Apple Launched an Apple Store as well as Apple’s first line of iPods. The iPod quickly revolutionized the music industry.  In 2003, Apple launched the iTunes Music Store.  In 2004, Jobs underwent surgery for his pancreatic cancer.  In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion.  In 2007, Apple released the first generation of iPhones. The iPhone quickly revolutionized the cellphone industry.  In 2010, Apple released the iPad. It was the device that young Jobs dreamed would be the ideal personal computer of the future.  In late 2011, Jobs resigned.One of Jobs’ most famous and inspiring speeches was given at a Stanford commencement address. In it, he shared the most pivotal points in his life and important lessons that he learned along the way.  Many important persons and famous technology leaders had things they wanted to say about Jobs’ passing. “I’m truly saddened to learn of Steve Jobs’ death. Melinda and I extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone Steve has touched through his work. Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives. The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely. ” Said Bill Gates. President Barack Obama had a little bit more to say, going so far as to analyze Jobs’ effect on the world. “Michelle and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve was among the greatest of American innovators – brave enough to think differently, bold enough to believe he could change the world, and talented enough to do it. By building one of the planet’s most successful companies from his garage, he exemplified the spirit of American ingenuity. By making computers personal and putting the internet in our pockets, he made the information revolution not only accessible, but intuitive and fun. And by turning his talents to storytelling, he has brought joy to millions of children and grownups alike. Steve was fond of saying that he lived every day like it was his last. Because he did, he transformed our lives, redefined entire industries, and achieved one of the rarest feats in human history: he changed the way each of us sees the world. The world has lost a visionary. And there may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve’s wife Laurene, his family, and all those who loved him.” “Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you.” Said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google Inc., also expressed his feelings. “He’s clearly the most effective and successful American CEO in the last 50 years. He didn’t just found Apple, and he didn’t actually just make it successful in the first decade, he also took it after a bad period, and rebuilt it. Which has essentially never been done in an American corporations, to be the extraordinary company it is today. To me, Steve proves that nerds don’t win. Artists do. And that Steve who is both a technologist, but really an artist, shows that art matters and the rest of us missed the fact that beautiful simple products are what people want.” “[Jobs is] a personal friend and I served on his board for three years. And in his case, working with his, they just adore working for him, and although he’s famously loud and precise and so forth, they respect him so much. I think in many ways, Steve is who he is because he’s just so smart. And that when you have someone who is just that brilliant and is able to integrate those ways in ways that almost no one else in the world can, he gets the extra bit of respect that allows him to be a great leader.” Jobs’ family released a statement on Wednesday saying “Steve died peacefully today surrounded by his family.” Jobs’ life and work means a lot of things to a lot of people, but I think we can all agree that  he positively affected the life of every one of us through his life-changing, enjoyable, and educational gadgets and devices. He has changed the way we interact with the world around us, the way we live our lives, and the way we express and share our emotions. Additionally, he reminds us that anyone can accomplish great dreams such as his by living each day doing their greatest work, and that they must not settle for doing work that is less than enjoyable. Here’s to a life well lived. Here’s to Steve Jobs. ","categories": ["Apple","Hot News"],

        "excerpt":"PhoneGap is one of the best technologies for budding mobile developers, as it combines very simple multi-use markup and scripting languages with the much sought after Mobile App development. PhoneGap provides services for building Android, iOS, Symbian, WebOS, Bada, and Blackberry devices, all with the use of simple languages. PhoneGap is a free and open-source technology that is becoming increasingly popular because of its use with Web Development languages that are very easy to pick up and many already know them.           Orbium &#8211; An Example of What Can Be Done with PhoneGap   You may wonder how does the making of an iPhone application work, by just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even if it does, it would have to be a pretty awful application. The applications created by PhoneGap are not these stellar works of arts (PhoneGap doesn’t have powerful graphics capabilities), but they are not awful. If utilized fully, PhoneGap can create some interesting games. Orbium ($0.99) is an example of an aesthetically appealing game for Mobile devices that was created using JavaScript and PhoneGap.  PhoneGap also comes with enough Native APIs and PhoneGap plug-ins to fill a bucket (bucket size is undetermined) such as the PhoneGap Compass, Accelerometer, and Geolocation. These features make-up for what would’ve been lost when ditching Objective-C. The full list of APIs can be found here. But a real jewel in PhoneGap is its PhoneGap Build, which allows you to upload your code and let PhoneGap build the application for you, all ready and organized for you to upload to the App Store(s).

        "title": "Dojo &#8211; Unbeatable JavaScript Tools",
        "excerpt":"JavaScript has become essential amongst Web Developers (probably developers in general). Whether it be AJAX, jQuery, JSON, or CoffeeScript it has become very prevalent and used in everyday application building, on both sides of the production spectrum. But JavaScript can become a hassle when you don’t have the right tools, or your tools have become too complicated for basic usage. Luckily, we have Dojo, a toolkit that provides code for completing various tasks such as presenting a pretty grid or a much nicer user interface.           This Interactive Calendar can be found on the Dojo Website   Dojo is an open-source technology created by the Dojo Foundation (primarily Alex Russell, Dylan Schiemann, and David Schlontzer) to ease the development of the complex AJAX language as well as JavaScript in general. And they did a bang-up job of it. Dojo’s APIs are bountiful, ranging from iOS compatibility to its Rich UI features. Here is an example of the Dojo “Hello, World.”                     1                          2                          3                          4                          5                          6                          7                          8                          9                          10                          11                          12                                          &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;                                  &lt;html&gt;                                  &lt;head&gt;                                      &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;                                      &lt;title&gt;Tutorial: Hello Dojo!&lt;/title&gt;                                      &lt;!-- load Dojo --&gt;                                      &lt;script src=\"&lt;a href=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.6.0/dojo/dojo.xd.js\"&gt;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/dojo/1.6.0/dojo/dojo.xd.js&lt;/a&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;                                  &lt;/head&gt;                                  &lt;body&gt;                                      &lt;h1 id=\"greeting\"&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;                                  &lt;/body&gt;                                  &lt;/html&gt;                    This was directly from the Dojo Documentation. As you can see, it works similarly to regular JavaScript but this is, quote-on-quote, vanilla. It is basic Dojo, but it kind of gives a basic feel for how it works. Here is a second example of Dojo  that displays a nice and neat graph (directly from the Dojo Documentation).             &lt;div id=&#8221;grid1&#8243; dojoType=&#8221;dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid&#8221; query=&#8221;{ Track: &#8216;*&#8217; }&#8221; rowsPerPage=&#8221;30&#8243; plugins='{nestedSorting: true, dnd: true, indirectSelection: true, menus:{headerMenu:&#8221;headerMenu&#8221;, rowMenu:&#8221;rowMenu&#8221;, cellMenu:&#8221;cellMenu&#8221;, selectedRegionMenu:&#8221;selectedRegionMenu&#8221;}}&#8217; store=&#8221;csvStore1&#8243; structure=&#8221;layout&#8221; rowSelector=&#8221;20px&#8221;&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.Menu&#8221; id=&#8221;headerMenu&#8221; style=&#8221;display: none;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Header Menu Item 1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Header Menu Item 2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Header Menu Item 3&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Header Menu Item 4&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.Menu&#8221; id=&#8221;rowMenu&#8221; style=&#8221;display: none;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Row Menu Item 1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Row Menu Item 2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Row Menu Item 3&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Row Menu Item 4&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.Menu&#8221; id=&#8221;cellMenu&#8221; style=&#8221;display: none;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Cell Menu Item 1&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Cell Menu Item 2&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Cell Menu Item 3&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Cell Menu Item 4&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.Menu&#8221; id=&#8221;selectedRegionMenu&#8221; style=&#8221;display: none;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Action 1 for Selected Region&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Action 2 for Selected Region&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Action 3 for Selected Region&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div dojoType=&#8221;dijit.MenuItem&#8221;&gt;Action 4 for Selected Region&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;       And here is what the finished product looks like:           This is on the Website: It is interactive and stuff   It is loaded with APIs that generally would be too difficult to program with out.

        "title": "9 Wacky But Successful Website Ideas",
        "excerpt":"      A lot of people play it safe, when trying to make money online. Ebay, Adsense, affiliate marketing, consulting or something along those lines. And, more often than not, these conventional ideas fail. Here is a list of nine people who weren&#8217;t afraid to try crazy ideas online and made a lot of money at it.           A Homepage Worth Millions Who would ever think that you can be rich out of being desperate? Well, Alex Tew can give you a lot of answers for that. When he was 21 years old, he decided to earn more cash for college by selling $1 pixels on his website. Talk about crazy, but he got his million in half a year’s time, and even major television stations wanted to interview the kid. He got so famous that hackers attacked his site, and many imitated his ideas so much that Alex’s latest projects dwindled in the end. Still, he made hi s millions, all because he needed to pay his tuition and books—and look where he’d gone from that.           ShitMyDadSays This is another site that can raise many eyebrows. Justin Halpern, an unemployed writer, had to move back to his parents’ house. As if this wasn’t mortifying enough, he had to live with his father’s constant jokes all throughout his stay. So what did he do? He created a Twitter account just for his father’s jokes. It was a huge hit; and in less than a month, the Daily Show was knocking at his door for an interview. What’s more, there were sitcoms and book deal offers that followed as well. This gives you one lesson in life: record your parent’s nagging from time to time. Who knows where it can take you, right?           PickyDomains.com Do you have trouble naming things? Well, Dmitry Daydov doesn’t. In fact, he likes it so much he decided to make a career out of it. So what did he do? He approached people who had trouble coming up with a domain name and offered them a great deal: if he could come up with a cool domain name, then they would pay him $50; if he didn’t, he would get nothing—as in “zero” nothing. This idea became an instant hit, and soon, he had trouble completing all the orders by himself. It became so popular that San Francisco wrote a story about him—and others joined too. (As a side note, you can check out a list of blog name generators on our list if you are coming up with a blog name for your site)           BugMeNot.com Ever feel irritated with those annoying websites that require users to register to get full access of their site? Well, Guy King feels for you. In fact, he feels for you so much, he decided to create a website that provided logins and passwords to people who didn’t like to give their email addresses during registration. His site became a success in 2004, and even caused the wrath of Wired magazine (who reportedly made an effort to shut his si te down). Today, BugMeNot has branched out in other similar niches, like RetailMeNot.com.           Doggles.com It must be fun being a dog&#8211;especially if your owners are Ken and Roni di Lullo. Not only do you get a tasty bone, but you also get to try out their invention&#8211;a Doggle sunglass. Yup, it sounds a bit cuckoo, but you&#8217;ll be surprised that their Doggles products are now sold in 4,500 different outlets in 16 countries. How did they do it? By marketing these sunglasses as a protective eyepiece that shields harmful UV radiation from a dog&#8217;s eyes. Many people think it&#8217;s the most &#8220;uncool&#8221; invention ever, but you&#8217;ve got to admit that even a man&#8217;s furry bestfriend looks cool in Doggles.           GeesePoliceInc.com Can you make $2 million dollars just by chasing geese away? Well,David Marcks can. He created GeesePoliceInc.com to prove his point—that there is money in anything. Apparently, he worked at a golf course that had many wild geese in it; and he decided to get rid of them by offering the services of his good, old, trusty Border Collie. And what did his dog do? He chased all the geese out of from the golf course. Today, he uses 27 trucks and 32 dogs to chase those poor, hapless geese away from municipal parks, golf courses, and land owners.           FindAGrave.com Do you like visiting graves of famous people? Then you should talk to Jim Tipton. He liked locating dead celebrities so much he even turned it into a profitable business. No, they’re not all famous, but that person has a grave—and if he has one, then most likely David will find it for you. His business became so famous that there is even a term created for it: “Tombstone Tourism”.           ShoppingCartAbuse.com It’s difficult to explain what this site does, so we’ll let the site do the talking: “The Center for Prevention of Shopping Cart Abuse is an organization dedicated to preventing the pervasiveness of Shopping Cart abuse”. Yes, it is a business—and yes, it is a successful commercial project as well. For other questions—go ask them.           WheresGeorge.com Ever wonder where the money you spent is right now? Yes, we’re talking about the actual money itself—you know, the one with the dead presidents? Well, the site works by getting the serial number of your money and tracking where it is right now. Don’t think it’s a joke; as of today, Where’s George is tracking around 190,623,138 bills, which has a whopping total of around USD$1,028,594,634.           David Deprice is a blogger at MadConomist.com. He is currently involved with two startups, Bloove.com and MyClasses.org    ","categories": ["Awesome Websites"],

        "title": "Cocos2D For iPhone Tutorial 4 &#8211; Touch Events",
        "excerpt":"   Welcome back to our Cocos2D tutorial series! Last time we went over the code that is used to move sprites on the screen. In this tutorial, I will be covering touch events. There are four touch events that can occur in the process of touching the screen of any touch-enabled device. These are:   Touch Start (When you first touch the screen)  Touch Move (When you slide your finger across the screen)  Touch Cancel (When something disrupts the touch)  Touch End (When you lift your finger off of the screen)  You can assign different code to be executed based upon touch events and the location of a touch. To demonstrate this, we will be creating a simple app in which the Cocos2D icon (or other image of your choice) moves to where you touch the screen. The code below is the final product, and I have removed the code for moving it across the screen (from the last tutorial).#import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"#import \"CCTouchDispatcher.h\"CCSprite *icon;@implementation HelloWorld+(id) scene{\tCCScene *scene = [CCScene node];\tHelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];\t[scene addChild: layer];\treturn scene;}-(id) init{\tif( (self=[super init] )) {\t\ticon = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@\"Icon.png\"];\t\ticon.position = ccp(300,200);\t\t[self addChild:icon];\t\t[[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher]addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES];\t}\treturn self;}- (void) dealloc{\t[super dealloc];}-(BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{\treturn YES;}-(void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{\tCGPoint location = [self convertTouchToNodeSpace: touch];\t[icon stopAllActions];\t[icon runAction:[CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:1 position:location]];}@endIf you run this program, you will find that it does exactly as I described above. A Cocos2D icon will appear on the screen and it will move to wherever you touch. #import \"CCTouchDispatcher.h\"Before we start working with touches, we have to import the CCTouchDispatcher header file. The code in this header file will allow us to work with touches. [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher]addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES];This line of code will tell CCLayer that our touch methods are going to be “Targeted” and in “self”, that our priority is 0 (high), and that we want to respond to touches. -(BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{\treturn YES;}When working with touch events, the “touch start” method is mandatory, while the other touch events are optional. In Cocos2D, the name of the “touch start” method is “ccTouchBegan” and it returns a boolean value. -(void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{\tCGPoint location = [self convertTouchToNodeSpace: touch];\t[icon stopAllActions];\t[icon runAction:[CCMoveTo actionWithDuration:1 position:location]];}The code within the “Touch End” event is run when the user releases their finger from the screen. The method itself is “ccTouchEnded”, and it doesn’t return any values (hence the “void”). Line one of our method sets the GCPoint (coordinate) “location” equal to the location of the touch. However, since the location of the touch isn’t a GCPoint, we must use the method “convertTouchToNodeSpace” to convert the touch location to GL coordinates, and then from GL coordinates to node-space. Next, we use the method “stopAllActions” to stop any actions that are currently in progress. With the code above, this line won’t actually make any difference (there are no other actions going on), but it is important to get in the habit of stopping all actions before initiating a new action. After we have stopped all actions, we use the method “runAction” to run the action specified in brackets. In this case, we move the icon to the location touched. “actionWithDuration” is used to specify how long we want the action to take place. In our program, we have set the duration to 1 second. Now that you understand what the code is doing, it should make sense that, when running your app in the iPhone Simulator, nothing happens when you first click it, nor when you slid your finger across the screen. The action only happens when you remove your finger from the screen because that is the touch event at which our code starts running. I hope that you have found this tutorial useful, and I encourage you to play around with these touch events. If you have any questions, or if you run into any problems, please leave a comment!

        "title": "How To Host Your Static Website On Dropbox &#038; Share It With A Free Domain",
        "excerpt":"   Those of us that work on multiple computers and need a quick and easy way to transfer files between workspaces have tried and loved the file hosting service Dropbox. Since its release, geeks have been developing clever uses for Dropbox’s unique file hosting and syncing service. It has been utilized for anything from syncing iTunes libraries, to providing a means of chatting among team members. Yet another creative use is website hosting. Using the public file folder option offered in Dropbox, users can host their web pages and effectively publish a small website with minimal hassle, and no cost. The first thing you’ll have to do is actually create a website. Since Dropbox merely hosts static files, and does not support server-side scripting or databases, your website will have to be limited to HTML, CSS, and Javascript (for client-side scripting). If you aren’t much of a website designer and/or coder, then you might consider using a website creation application like iWeb or Dreamweaver. Next, place all of the files associated with your website in the “Public” folder in your Dropbox folder. If, for some odd reason, you find that you don’t have a Public folder, create a new folder called “Public” in your Dropbox folder and place your website files inside of that (Dropbox assigns a folder as public based upon its name.) Because your files are now Public, anyone that knows the URL of one of your files can view it on the web. The next step is to find out what the URL of your index.html file is. To do this, navigate to your Public folder and right click your index.html file. Under the Dropbox option that appears, select “copy public link.” Open your favorite browser, paste this link in the address bar, and hit your enter/return key. Your index page should appear in its full glory. Since all of your website files are in the same directory, links between your pages will work.  You could stop now, for your entire site is now published to the web and you can share the URL with your friends. However, you may have noticed that the URL of your website is somewhat ridiculous. You could take the easy way out and use a link shortener to share your website, or you could mask your URL with a free domain service like CO.CC. If you want to use a custom domain that mirrors your filesystem (ie. not in a frame,) you should check out a nifty little service called kissr.co. Once you have signed up with Kissr and connected your account to your Dropbox account, you will be able to designate any folder in your Dropbox folder as the root of your website. Then, you can choose a Kissr.co subdomain for your website, or connect Kissr to one of your premium domains. ","categories": ["How To"],

        "title": "Why Piracy Isn&#8217;t Theft, And Why You Should Question Copyright",
        "excerpt":"For many dozens of years, pirates roamed the open seas and pillaged and plundered any ships or villages they came across. They used extreme violence to rob honest groups of people of their hard earned wealth. Pirates were nasty scumbags who committed crimes for a living. In the modern age of technology, the meaning of “piracy” has taken a new form. Thanks to the freedom of the internet, anyone can download anything for free, no matter what the price of the content is. Obviously, this is illegal because it infringes on the copyright holder’s rights. Also, it is considered by many to be theft because people who obtain paid content for nothing are decreasing the amount of money that the creator(s) are making. Contrary to popular belief, piracy is not theft. Theft is taking something from someone against their will, thus removing their copy and giving the thief a copy. When it comes to digital piracy, the unauthorized use or reproduction of another’s work, nothing is taken away from the author except for potential profits. These potential profits that authors seem to feel exist are actually quite illogical. It’s very naive of them to assume  that every single pirate would have bought their content if they couldn’t get it for free. Most of them wouldn’t buy it because they can’t afford it, they don’t think it’s worth the price, or they want to try it out before they buy it (and they find that it doesn’t suit their needs.)   [youtube_sc url=&#8221;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTybKL1pM4&#8243;]   Piracy seems like a terrible thing at first, because it is only logical that  if consumers don&#8217;t feed the software, music, and movie industries, then in the future barely anyone will bother to produce the content in the first place. However, if all digital content was free, then content could reach more people more easily. If people enjoy content, then they will want to give money to the creator to thank them and encourage them to make more.   As Notch, the creator of the wildly popular game Minecraft, pointed out in a blog post, if pirates really enjoy content, then they will probably talk about it with their friends. They might then convince their friends to purchase the game, and the content author will then enjoy more profits than they would have if their content wasn&#8217;t pirated. This demonstrates, on a tiny scale, that free content can spread more rapidly and be recognized by a greater number of people than paid content. With more people comes more demand for the content, and thus more income that the author will receive.  More often than not, it is easier to pirate content than to buy it. Pirates can just go to a website like thepiratebay.org and start downloading the movie that they’re dying to see, while the honest consumer has to, at best, first purchase a subscription to a service like Netflix, then hope that it’s available for streaming as they browse the Netflix website. Many movies are only available on DVD, you you would have to request it, wait for it, get it, and watch tons of trailers and warning screens before you could watch the movie. Content authors should stop and think about why people pirate their content before they go on a rampage and shout “Unfair! Unfair! You bloody thieves!” from the rooftops. In summary, pirates aren’t thieves, copyright should be respected for the time being, and copyright owners should rethink their business strategies. ","categories": ["Uncategorized"],

        "title": "Grooveshark Is About To Be Killed By Universal Music Group",
        "excerpt":" Grooveshark is a popular music streaming service that thrives because of two key features:   It’s entirely free (with the option to pay for special, completely unnecessary, features)  Most content is uploaded by users (resulting in many millions of songs that span every genre of music culture)It started off as a rather illegal file sharing website, but after their growth rate skyrocketed, they realized that they would have to switch to a more legal business strategy. The new Grooveshark featured a clean interface that gave users the ability to listen to any of the millions of songs in Grooveshark’s massive database. Whenever artists of record companies complained about their music being available on it, the Grooveshark staff would respond accordingly and remove the infringing content. Many websites, including YouTube and Facebook, can legally operate while hosting copyrighted content because of  the safe-harbor provisions provided in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This essentially means that  the owners and hosters of websites are not held responsible for the actions of their users (simply because it is nearly impossible to keep track of the content that every single user posts on a  wildly popular website.) Grooveshark thrived because of this act, and they even started to try to pay artists for their work. These safe-harbor provisions do not, however, protect the owners of a website when they share copyrighted content. This is exactly why Universal Music Group is suing Grooveshark for $15 billion dollars. Universal claims that the executives of Grooveshark have, collectively, uploaded over 100,000 songs to the Grooveshark database. Grooveshark seems to think that this was based off of an anonymous blog comment, in which case Universal has no grounds to sue on. Grooveshark staff are denying that they uploaded even a single track to their service. However, if Universal can, in fact, prove that executives of the Grooveshark staff uploaded copyrighted content, then this is certainly the end of Grooveshark. They will be sued into oblivian. Grooveshark is a great website, but it just wasn’t meant to be. It changed its ways over the years, and it managed to get by, but I fear that this will be the end of it. There is no need to fret, though, because there will always be plenty of other websites that offer similar services. In addition, music streaming services that used to be costly are adopting a freemium business model due to successful applications like Spotify that are slowly taking over the market.

        "title": "Enhance Your Browsing Experience With These 9 Great Chrome Extensions",
        "excerpt":"   Since its release, Google Chrome has been rapidly gaining users. As of now, over 200 million people have installed google chrome, and about 24% of web traffic is made through the Chrome browser. While Chrome is great on its own, extensions can enhance your browsing experience even more. I have been using Google Chrome for almost a year now, and a couple of months ago I started exploring the realm of Google extensions. The official library of extensions can be found at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions, and, while they are somewhat organized, it can be difficult to find the best extensions while digging through hundreds upon hundreds of uninteresting or useless ones. In this post, I hope to share with you what I have found to be the 9 greatest extensions for Google Chrome. Enjoy! 1. AdBlock Plus    The internet is coated with layers of obnoxious ads that take the form of anything from blaring noise to flashing neon rectangles. Often intended to help the website owner make a living, they are sometimes overused and/or abused. This extension will prevent almost any ad from displaying, including  ads overlayed on videos and mysterious audio ads. The web will no longer test your patience and bog down your computer with millions of pop-ups and tricky ads that cover up the content that you are trying to read. Keep in mind that, in order to maintain an internet with free content, content authors have to make money. Make sure to add blocking exceptions for the websites that you enjoy. You can install AdBlock Plus here. 2. FastestChrome Everyone wants to browse the web more efficiently, and FastestChrome helps you do just that. It provides a ton of features, but the most obvious and helpful ones are automatic next page loads (it will seem like one endless page, and it works especially well with Google searches,) the definition of highlighted words will be displayed in a small bubble,  text URLs are changed to links, shopping recommendations will appear on popular shopping websites and Google searches, and easy search engine queries can be made made from highlighted words. You can install FaststChrome here. 3. Awesome Screenshot      As the name suggests, Awesome Screenshot lets you take a screenshot of any portion of any web page. You can capture a selected area, the entire visible potion, or the entire page. It then provides a handy tool set for editing and annotating the resulting image. You can draw rectangles and circles around important information, or even use a blur tool to hide personal information. Once you are done editing, you can either save the screenshot locally or instantly upload your screenshot to their website (you will receive a sharable link to it.) You can install Awesome Screenshot here. 4. TooManyTabs If you’re anything like me when you browse the web, then you quickly fill your tab bar up with dozens of websites. The titles of pages start to overlap, and you can’t remember how many tabs in that YouTube video you were going to watch is. TooManyTabs helps you manage your tabs while you are browsing the web. With the press of a button, a bird’s eye view of all open tabs is displayed. You can do a  search for a tab, sort tabs (by time, title, and domain,) restore recently closed tabs, and suspend tabs (kind of like removing then from your tab bar and putting them into memory.) You can install TooManyTabs here. 5. Smooth Gestures Smooth Gestures will give you the ability to perform specific actions simply by clicking and dragging the right mouse button in certain gestures. There are dozens of default gestures that include anything from swiping left to go back one page in history, to opening a link in a new tab by right clicking a link and dragging up. These gestures will make you more efficient when browsing the web, and they will make navigating the web even more enjoyable. One of my favorite features of Smooth Gestures is the ability to add custom gestures. You can move your mouse in any formation and then assign a specific action to that gesture. For example, I could make a gesture that consists of drawing a “B” and causes  to be loaded in the current page. You can install Smooth Gestures here. 6. YouTube Downloader      YouTube Downloader let you, well, download videos from YouTube. A neat little “Download” button will appear below every YouTube video, and clicking on it will cause a drop down menu to appear. The drop down menu offers downloads of the video in 3 different formats, each in with various quality options. You can install YouTube Downloader here. 7. Clickable Links For some reason, many website creators decide not to make URLs and email addresses clickable. This results in the annoyance of having to copy and paste URLs into the address bar (how ghastly!) or copying and pasting email addresses into email clients. With Clickable Links, all URLs and email addresses will be made clickable! If you have FastestChrome installed, then you can skip over this one because it includes this functionality. You can install Clickable Links here. 8. LastPass LastPass is a great online password manager and form filler. It will capture all of your usernames and passwords from around the web and, after encrypting them, store them safely on both the cloud and your machine. It can then automatically fill out any form and username/password field for you in the future. All of your login information is stored under one master password that you can use to login to the LastPass website (where you can organize and view login information.) Another nifty feature is the ability to generate a long and completely random password for your accounts, which will result in more security. Since you don’t have to remember your passwords, complicated paswords won’t be a problem. Of course, if you don’t know your passwords by heart, then it would make sense that you won’t be able to login to your accounts on other computers. However, LastPass has the ability to synchronize your account information across all of your devices, so this won’t be a problem. You can install LastPass here. 9. AddThis      With AddThis, you will be able to instantly share any content on the web to over 300 social networking and bookmarking services. Sharing can be done by clicking the AddThis button or right clicking any web page. Some bonus features include easily bookmarking, printing, and translating pages. You can install AddThis here.

        "title": "RobotC Tutorial 3 &#8211; Functions",
        "excerpt":"     To make life easier when programming, sometimes people may use things called functions. Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Fuctions can be used to reduce the complexity of a code, and to make it more clear. In RobotC, I use functions a lot because they help other people understand what the code does.   Let&#8217;s start out basic. Functions in RobotC are made by typing void name(). Replace name with the name of your function, and you&#8217;re set. Let&#8217;s take a look at a sample program I made. void one(){motor[motorB] = 50;motor[motorC] = 50;}void two(){motor[motorB] = -50;motor[motorC] = -50;}task main() {one();wait1Msec(1000);two();wait1Msec(2000);}  This is a simple example of functions. In the task main, it runs the function &#8220;one&#8221;, which codes for going forward, for one second. I then runs &#8220;two&#8221;, which codes for going backward, for two seconds. In order to include a function defined outside of the main function, you use the format &#8220;name();&#8221;. Functions can be used for much more than this, but this is a simple example. We will be using them more in the next tutorial, using sensors. ","categories": ["RobotC"],

        "title": "RobotC Tutorial 4 &#8211; Using Sensors",
        "excerpt":"   Sensors are the main part of the NXT, and are the items that the NXT is most useful for. The NXT has four types sensors that come with it: the ultrasonic sensor, the light sensor, the touch sensor, and the sound sensor. Later models come with a color sensor that replaces light, but I prefer the light over color. Let’s get straight to programming. #pragma config(Sensor, S1, touch, sensorTouch)What’s this, you say? It is saying that the sensor is in sensor port 1, named “touch”, and it is a touch sensor. Now we dont want to type that every time, so to automatically insert it, go to Robot&gt;Motors and Sensors Setup, and go to the sensor tab to fill in the sensor info. Click OK and the text should be at the top of your code. You need these lines to have the sensors work. In order to program sensors, we need to learn two simple but very helpful statements. These are the “While” and “If” statements. In this tutorial, though, I will just be going over the while statement. Let’s look at another program. while(SensorValue(touch) == 0){motor[motorC] = 50;motor[motorB] = 50;}motor[motorB] = -50;motor[motorC] = -50;wait1Msec(500);This tells the robot to go forward while the touch sensor is not pressed, the go back a little when it is pressed. For the first line here, you put the name of the sensor, in this case “touch” in the parenthesis, use an equality (==) or inequality (!=) sign, and a set a value. For the touch sensor, there are only two values, 0 (not pressed) or 1 (pressed). For the ultrasonic sensor, the value is distance, and for color, the value is the reflected light. I don’t use the sound sensor very often because I think it does not have much value in programs. Now here is a more complex program using ultrasonic and touch sensors. #pragma config(Sensor, S1, touch, sensorTouch)#pragma config(Sensor, S4, sonar, sensorSONAR)task main(){while(true){while(SensorValue(touch) == 1){motor[motorD] = -25;motor[motorE] = -25;wait1Msec(200);motor[motorD] = 25;motor[motorE] = -25;wait1Msec(250);}while(SensorValue(sonar) &lt; 25){motor[motorD] = 0;motor[motorE] = 0;wait1Msec(250);PlaySound(soundBeepBeep);}motor[motorD] = 25;motor[motorE] = 25;}}What you might notice here is the “while(true)”. This is an infinite loop so the program will run forever (or until you stop it.) I use that to loop the program. This program codes the robot to, while the touch sensor is pressed, back up and turn. Also, while there is an object in the way, it will stop and play an annoying beeping sound until you move the object. When everything is clear, the robot will simply go forward. Now, how can we incorporate functions into this? Let’s take a look. task main()while(true){while(SensorValue(touch) == 1){one();}while(SensorValue(sonar) &lt; 25){two();}}So, while the touch sensor is pressed, it will run the function “one”, and when there is an object in the robot’s way, it will run the function “two”. That is all for now. Next time, we will look at the light sensor more and I will show you how to follow lines. If you have any questions, be brave and leave a comment! ","categories": ["RobotC"],

        "title": "5 Simple Yet Fun Mac Games: Macintosh Has Always Been A Gaming Platform",
        "excerpt":"One huge knock on the Mac in the past is the lack of gaming in comparison to the PC. Even though it paled in comparison, there was always a nice collection of games that has been available for Mac users. For the serious gamer, however, a few great games wasn’t enough. Times have changed, and the Mac now offers limitless hours of gaming for every type of gamer. Whether you like shooters, poker games, or puzzle games, chances are you will find something to your liking in relatively new application stores like Steam or the Mac App Store. Below are some of what I find to be the more addictive classic games out there for Macintosh.   Bejeweled  I’m sure that I just raised some eyebrows. Yes, the wildly addictive Tetris variant that has hundreds of clones to date has had a version for the Mac for those with OS X 10.3.9 or later for quite some years. The game is deceptively simple, but is great for wasting several hours as you see how many gems you can clear. There are three official versions that have been made to date, and they can be found here (version 1), here (version 2), and here (version 3).   Etch A Sketch  While this may not seem like your typical game, many of you have likely owned an Etch A Sketch as a child. Now you can get a Mac version of the toy as long as you have OS X 10.4 or better and an Intel processor. It incorporates the basic elements of an Etch-A-Sketch into a simple game. You can download Etch A Sketch here.   Quinn    We mentioned Tetris earlier. If you like Tetris and the never ending hoard of Tetris clones, then you will love Quinn. The one thing that separates it from most Tetris clones is that you have the option to play on a network against your friends. However, one of you must host the game. You can download Quinn here.   PokerTH  If you would like to play a poker tournament on Mac or Windows, you will love PokerTH. This game is cross platform and will allow you to play with up to seven other players over the internet or in offline mode. Equal to a single table sit and go tournament, this gives you all the thrill and excitement of poker, but without risking any money. You can download PokerTH here.   Armagetron Advanced    For those of you that love Tron, you should try Armagetron Advanced. It is your typical light cycle race, but in 3-D. For those not versed in Tron, a light cycle race is a race between two motorcycles that leaves an electronic trail behind you that can kill you if you touch it. Avoid the light walls and try to trap your opponent. In addition, you have the option to play either against the computer or against your friends. You can download Armagetron Advanced here.   Reese McKenzie is a gaming enthusiast who especially enjoys poker. ","categories": ["Gaming","Mac"],

        "title": "Three Text Editor Alternatives To TextMate",
        "excerpt":"TextMate is one of the greatest text editors for the Mac. Unfortunately, many would be developers are deterred by its price tag (around $55) or simply cannot use the editor as it is Macintosh-only. These three text editors may provide decent alternatives for the various caveats associated with TextMate. 1. Sublime Text (1 and 2) Sublime Text is a Text-editor heavily inspired by TextMate. Sublime Text provides solutions for some of TextMate’s caveats; Sublime works on Windows and Linux platforms as well as Mac, while retaining TextMate’s simplistic charm. In addition to many of TextMate’s high-heralded features (Macros, Snippets…), Sublime Text has an interesting mini-map feature that they claim allows the code to be viewed from a distance of 10,000 feet. This may be a stretch, as 1.89 miles is a long ways away to see a tiny screen but I doubt it is necessary to edit code from that distance. Currently, Sublime Text is priced at $59, but there is a Free Download that showcases the Beta Version of Sublime Text 2. It is practically a full version and it never expires. You can visit the website here.             It&#8217;s Not a Knock-off of TextMate, As It Has a Different Interface               Java in Sublime     2. CodeRunner This application is Mac-only and available only from the Mac App Store. If you happen to be feuding with the store, or scorn the Mac App store, I suggest you avoid this to prevent any stress. CodeRunner, by KrillApps, is a simple text editor boasts a built-in compiler. It does not carry the full weight of an IDE, yet it carries features of a Text Editor and a Compiler. In addition to the Compiler, several other common features with editors and IDEs like syntax highlighting, color themes, and a built-in file browser are included. CodeRunner by KrillApps is $9.99 on the Mac Application Store.           Ta-Da.               Nice?     3. RedCar Editor If you are feeling particularly adventurous, you can always try out RedCar Editor. It is still in its Alpha stages, but by the looks of the editor, it has potential. RedCar has the interface very similar to that of TextMate. But there are three major advantages to RedCar Editor: 1) It’s open source (redcar on GitHub), 2) It’s extensible via Ruby, and 3) It is cross-platform. But as stated, the editor is still in its Alpha stage of the development process. Feel free, though, to try out the code from the RedCar website.           Looks Like TextMate, eh?               Windows Version     These are a couple alternatives to TextMate. Of course there are smaller editors such as Kod, or Editra, but they aren’t quite similar to the full-functionality of TextMate. If you have any suggestions, we’d love to hear them! Just leave them in the comments! ","categories": ["Mac","Programming","Review"],

        "title": "Cocos2D For iPhone Tutorial 5 &#8211; Labels, Menus, And Menu Elements",
        "excerpt":" We really wore our fingers raw in our last tutorial by running dozens of touch events! In this tutorial I will be showing you how to make a gorgeous button-filled menu for your iOS app. By menu, I mean an array of buttons that can either be made from an image label or a text label, and can have a function executed when they are pressed. These menus can either be placed in their own scene, like a game start menu, or as a control menu overlaid on a scene. Before we can make a text label in a menu, we need to know how to make a text label. As you may have noticed, this is exactly what the default Cocos2D program does. However, the way it positions it on the screen is a little advanced, so here is my slightly modified version: #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"@implementation HelloWorld+(id) scene{\tCCScene *scene = [CCScene node];\tHelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];\t[scene addChild: layer];\treturn scene;}-(id) init{\tif( (self=[super init] )) {\t\tCCLabelTTF *label = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Hello World\" fontName:@\"Times New Roman\" fontSize:64];\t\tlabel.position = ccp(240,160);\t\tlabel.color = ccc3(255, 255, 255);\t\t[self addChild: label];\t}\treturn self;}- (void) dealloc{\t[super dealloc];}@endThe above code in HelloWorldScene.m will output “Hello World” to the screen with the font “Marker Felt” and with the font size “64”. CCLabelTTF *label = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Hello World\" fontName:@\"Marker Felt\" fontSize:64];This line creates a label called “label” that is the member of the CCLabelTTF class. In order to give it some basic properties, we have to set it equal to, or initialize it, with a CCLabelTTF object with a label, font, and font size. The label and the size are self-explanatory, but for more fonts check out this list. label.position = ccp(240,160);Like many objects in Cocos2D, labels have the property “position”. This line simply sets the position of the center of the label equal to the coordinate (240,160). Take note that this is a ccp, or CGPoint, coordinate. This is the kind of coordinate that you use in Cocos2D. label.color = ccc3(255, 255, 255);Another property that labels have is color. Here, we set the label’s color to white. It is unnecessary to set a color, and the default is white. The color is an RGB code, and I suggest you use a color picker like this one to choose a color. There you have it, we placed a simple label on the screen. There are other kinds of labels, but we will save them for later tutorials. Next, let’s create our menu. #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"@implementation HelloWorld+(id) scene{\tCCScene *scene = [CCScene node];\tHelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];\t[scene addChild: layer];\treturn scene;}-(id) init{\tif( (self=[super init] )) {\t\tCCLabelTTF *start = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Start!\" fontName:@\"Georgia-Bold\" fontSize:25];\t\tCCLabelTTF *options = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Options\" fontName:@\"Georgia-Bold\" fontSize:25];\t\tCCMenuItemLabel *item1 = [CCMenuItemLabel itemWithLabel:start target:self selector:@selector(startGame:)];\t\tCCMenuItemLabel *item2 = [CCMenuItemLabel itemWithLabel:options target:self selector:@selector(optionsPage:)];\t\tCCMenu *menu = [CCMenu menuWithItems:item1, item2, nil];\t\t[menu alignItemsVertically];\t\t[self addChild:menu];\t}\treturn self;}-(void)startGame:(id)sender{//code goes here}-(void)optionsPage:(id)sender{//code goes here}- (void) dealloc{\t[super dealloc];}@endThe above code will produce this:    CCLabelTTF *start = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Start!\" fontName:@\"Georgia-Bold\" fontSize:25];CCLabelTTF *options = [CCLabelTTF labelWithString:@\"Options\" fontName:@\"Georgia-Bold\" fontSize:25];The first thing we have to do to create a menu item with a label is actually create the labels. These two lines of code create two labels with the font Georgia-Bold. CCMenuItemLabel *item1 = [CCMenuItemLabel itemWithLabel:start target:self selector:@selector(startGame:)];CCMenuItemLabel *item2 = [CCMenuItemLabel itemWithLabel:options target:self selector:@selector(optionsPage:)];Next, we create two menu items, item1 and item2. They are of the class CCMenuItemLabel. We then have to initialize them with a label (the name of a CCLabelTTF object that has been created), a target, and a function to run when they are touched. -(void)startGame:(id)sender{//code goes here}-(void)optionsPage:(id)sender{//code goes here}Skipping down a little bit, these are simply the two void functions that our menu items will call when they are touched. We will add some content to them in a later tutorial. CCMenu *menu = [CCMenu menuWithItems:item1, item2, nil];This line creates a menu called “menu” and it initializes the menu with the items “item1” and “item2”. We set the last item to “nil” to end our menu. [menu alignItemsVertically];Without this line, all of the elements on our menu would be stacked on top of each other. This line aligns our menu items vertically. You could also align the items horizontally, or specify the position of each menu item. By default, the menu is placed in the center of the screen, but we could also specify the exact position (menu.position) of the menu. Our program now displays a nice text menu on the screen. However, if we were to make a game, we would want graphical menu items. No problem, we can do that in Cocos2D quickly and easily. #import \"HelloWorldScene.h\"@implementation HelloWorld+(id) scene{\tCCScene *scene = [CCScene node];\tHelloWorld *layer = [HelloWorld node];\t[scene addChild: layer];\treturn scene;}-(id) init{\tif( (self=[super init] )) {\t\tCCMenuItem *item1 = [CCMenuItemImage itemFromNormalImage:@\"start.png\" selectedImage:@\"startPressed.png\" target:self selector:@selector(startGame:)];\t\tCCMenu *menu = [CCMenu menuWithItems:item1, nil];\t\t[menu alignItemsVertically];\t\t[self addChild:menu];\t}\treturn self;}-(void)startGame:(id)sender{//code goes here}- (void) dealloc{\t[super dealloc];}@endThe above program will display the following when run:    CCMenuItem *item1 = [CCMenuItemImage itemFromNormalImage:@\"start.png\" selectedImage:@\"startPressed.png\" target:self selector:@selector(startGame:)];This line creates a menu item called “item1” that is initialized with the images start.png and startPressed.png, the target “self”, and the function “startGame”. The image file specified after the method “itemFromNormalImage” is the initial image of the menu item, and the image file specified after the method “selectedImage” is the image of the menu item while it is being touched. That’s all for now, folks! I hope you found my tutorial helpful. ","categories": ["Cocos2D"],

        "title": "Top 3 Free Screen Capture Tools",
        "excerpt":"Whether you’re trying to provide some tech support for a friend, showing off that new computer game you bought, or trying to include some screenshots in a blog post, there’s a good chance you will find yourself in need of a good screen capture tool to generate an image of your screen. On both Windows and Macintosh, the built-in screen capture tools are barely adequate and leave a lot to be desired. In this post, I hope to share with you what I have found to be three great screen capture applications.   Skitch      Skitch is a highly functional image editing application that doubles as a screen capture tool. You can import your own images into it, or hit the &#8220;Snap&#8221; button to select an area of your screen to capture. There are three different kinds of screenshots that can be taken: fullscreen, application window, or a user selected area on the screen. The captured image is then sent to the Skitch editing screen where you can sketch over it, crop it, annotate it, draw on it, and more. Once you are done editing, there is a handy &#8220;Drag Me&#8221; tab that lets you drag and drop the edited image onto your desktop, or into an open document. Alternatively, you can instantly upload it to Skitch.com, a FTP server, or Flickr.com. Over six image formats are supported, and the user can select image quality. Another helpful feature is a snapshot history. In short, Skitch is loaded with useful features that make taking and editing screenshots quick and easy.   You can find Skitch for Mac HERE.   SnapNDrag      SnapNDrag is an extremely simple and lightweight application that is great at what it does. As you can see in the screenshot above, there are three different methods of capture. Users can capture a selection, a window, or the entire screen. There is also the option to take a timed screenshot. Once the screenshot has been taken, users can choose to export it in one of multiple formats and sizes. If desired, the name of the screenshot can be changed. Exporting the screenshot is as easy as dragging onto a desktop or document.   You can get SnapNDrag for the Mac HERE.   Jing    Jing is most popular for its quick and easy video capturing feature, but it also boasts a useful screen capture feature with plenty of editing and exporting options. The Jing control menu resides in the top right of the screen, and, when the screen capture tool is clicked, users can select any area of the screen they wish to capture. The Jing editor will then pop up and let them add shapes, outlines, arrows, text, highlights, and more to the screenshot. Once the screenshot has ben edited, it can be exported to Screencast, and FTP server, Flickr, or the computer it is running on. You can download Jing for both Mac and Windows HERE. Thus ends our screen capture application roundup. If you think I missed any useful screen capture tools, please leave a comment and tell us what it is! ","categories": ["Review","Software"],

        "title": "5 Essential iPhone Business Apps",
        "excerpt":"When the Apple iPhone was introduced by the late Steve Jobs to the tech-hungry masses back in 2007, the thought of the gizmo becoming an essential business productivity tool was initially shunned by naysayers who pointed to the supremacy of the BlackBerry as the only mobile device suitable for business. That argument may have held some ground in the early days of the first-generation iPhone; after all, the new king of the smartphones couldn’t even be added to an AT&amp;T business account in the United States until 2008. But once third-party app developers began to make business apps that truly took advantage of the iPhone’s versatility, companies of all sizes adapted to the new paradigm of doing business on the go. The following five apps are essential iPhone tools for doing business:  Dropbox If there is one Internet service that can justify the advent of wireless broadband internet, Dropbox would be the first choice. Dropbox is one of the better examples of how cloud computing can empower mobile Internet users with its award-winning file storage and sharing system. The free version of Dropbox offers lots of features and plenty of storage space, but for medium-sized and large businesses, the enterprise edition is a must. With Dropbox, the seamless sharing and storage of any file with coworkers and business partners is just a simple drag-and-drop operation. The Dropbox app for the iPhone works better when the program has been previously installed on a desktop workstation, since it can be synchronized across devices. Square This amazing device has been praised for its highly innovative approach to processing credit and debit card payments. Square essentially transforms iPhones into sophisticated credit card terminals, complete with card swipe functionality to keep merchant fees low and reduce the possibility of fraud. The combination card reader and mobile app transforms an iPhone into a full-blown Point of Sale terminal without any hardware investments or complex software installations.      Tripit    Small company owners and individual professionals who frequently travel for business purposes can often have a difficult time organizing their schedules. Receiving different email messages and confirmations for flights, hotels and rental cars and fishing pertinent information therein can be an exercise in confusion and frustration. Tripit is a very smart solution to the problem. Instead of cutting and pasting, Tripit collects all emails related to travel plans and displays them in neat itineraries that can be accessed and shared with clients, coworkers and business partners at anytime.      WebEx Meeting Center   Video conferencing software has revolutionized the way business is conducted around the world. The iPhone is a natural device for making video calls and sharing information, but it requires the right mobile app to turn it into a powerful business platform for communication. The WebEx Meeting Center is an app by Cisco that leverages the power of wireless broadband Internet access by providing business users with an online conference room. Multitasking can be easily accomplished with WebEx, as it allows users to join ongoing conferences, hand off control of the meeting, and share documents with all attendants via a simplified login procedure.   This is a guest article by Ruben Corbo, a writer for the website Broadband Expert where you can find broadband internet in your area and compare prices on different deals for your mobile broadband needs.

        "title": "Google to Allow Minors On Google+",
        "excerpt":"   If you have been browsing Google lately, you may have noticed an annoying pop-up that alerts you about Google’s new privacy policy. This policy essentially allows Google to follow the activity of users across YouTube, Google, and Gmail. It doesn’t initially sound like anything new, but it actually brings data collecting and analysis to a whole new level. Google will start to combine all of the data it has about its users, and create more targeted ads that follow people from website to website. It could also affect search results. Based upon internet activity, Google could tailor results to people’s taste. The reason for this change probably has something to do with competing with Facebook and Apple. Both of these companies have successfully unified user data to create a profitable ecosystem (so to speak) that reacts to user activity.  I don’t know about you, but I find this a bit disturbing. I don’t want any company tracking me and knowing my every move on the internet. Up to here, this sounds a little bit unrelated. However, it leads to the next news bulletin, which is that Google+  will allow minors (ages 13 and up) to join. Starting in March, teenagers can start sharing their life with their friends and family, all the while being tracked by Google. Under this new policy, the information gathered about teenagers can be combined to provide Google with a handy online portrait about them. Before you start fretting, remember that websites like Facebook have been doing this, or something very similar to this, for quite some time. So far, it has worked out well enough. Also, Google+ has some privacy settings and features that give it a slight advantage over other social networks. For example, teens can create Circles with their friends in them and then only share content with those friends. There will also be some new features that will only be available for teenagers. Warnings will be shown to minors when they make public posts, and contact with people outside of their circles will be turned off by default. All of these features helps ensure that personal information doesn’t leak out into the public. Allowing minors to join is probably a good move for Google+. It will help their social network community grow and compete with the 800 million user strong Facebook. But is this new policy and age requirement better for the experience and privacy of us users? We’ll have to wait and see. ","categories": ["Google","Hot News","Social Networking"],

        "title": "Google Music Update Allows Users to Download Songs",
        "excerpt":"   When Google announced its online music locker service Google Music, we were impressed, but it did lack some important features. For one, users couldn’t download their music. While this could be circumvented with a simple browser extension, it was a major inconvenience. A recent update allows users to download songs and albums from their Google Music library. As shown above, you can download a certain song by clicking the options button to the right of the song’s name. To download a group of songs, select multiple tracks, click the options triangle, and select “Download Selected Songs”. The same can be done with albums. One of the limitations, however, is that each song can only be downloaded twice from the web interface. You can get by this limitation if you download the Music Manager app for Google Music (you probably already have it installed- it’s how you uploaded your music in the first place) and click the big “Export To Library” button. This can be done an unlimited number of times on an unlimited number of computers, making it perfect for transferring your music library around. You are not limited to only downloading songs that you uploaded. You can also download songs that you purchased through Google Music (thus bringing meaning to the purchasing music!) or selected from the freebie track library. If you’re a cheapskate, it might be worth checking out the freebie library for a couple of good songs to download. ","categories": ["Google","Hot News","Music"],

        "title": "Power Struggles: Increasing Your Android’s Battery Life",
        "excerpt":"If you’re anything like me, you probably have something to say about the battery life on your Android device. My Nexus battery drains power at an unbelievable rate. If it were up to me, I would be able to surf the web looking at pictures of cute cats and toggle back and forth between Words With Friends and Flood-It all day.  However, if you’re looking to improve your battery life, there are a few great apps you should check out. None of these apps will make your battery stronger, but they will sure help your phone go further on a single charge. Green Power Price- free  If you’ve ever been concerned about how valiantly your device tries to access a Wi-Fi network that just doesn’t exist, Green Power is the app for you. You can configure how long your device tries to access Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data before giving up (a really helpful tool for devices that swear they’re picking up a network signal that just won’t allow them to connect for some reason). It is also fully automatic which means that once you’ve configured it, you don’t have to keep activating the app. You can just sit back and enjoy longer battery life. Juice Defender __ Price- free-$4.99  Juice Defender operates similarly to Green Power, managing your Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data. It’s the upgrade, UltimateJuice, which is really worth mentioning. If you use an app like Pandora or Stitcher that relies on streaming, you can adjust the settings with UltimateJuice to allow certain apps to access Wi-Fi uninterrupted. Battery Indicator Pro __ Price-$2.49  Battery Indicator Pro does not possess actual power saving features but it does a great job of telling you how your battery life is being spent. The Pro version, an upgrade from the free standard version, also includes a file where your phone can log your battery activity, noting spikes in usage and documenting which apps take up the most juice. The app also includes a percentage in the status bar at the top of your device’s home screen that indicates the exact amount of battery you have left. You might not be able to do all your favorite mobile device activities without occasionally returning to a power outlet, but these apps will cut down on the amount of time your phone has to stay tethered to the wall.

        "title": "Where Technology is Headed in 2012",
        "excerpt":"After another action-packed Consumer Electronics Show in glittering Las Vegas this year, it seems that there’s plenty of high-tech kit to keep an eye on during the next few months. When it comes to deciding which is going to be the key area of development in the electronics industry, it can be tricky to pick one spot that looks destined to dominate. Of course, it’s tablets and smartphones that look likely to be the biggest area of development, with a raft of new devices pencilled in for release. CES saw phones that boasted better connectivity both via 4G mobile networks and also the internet capabilities packaged inside these tiny gadgets. What’s more, it looks like smartphones will finally get the cameras they need to push point and shoot compact models out of the way. Going Wireless    And it’s also the wonderful world of wireless that is set to become a bigger part of owning any kind of gadget and gizmo, including cameras. The likes of Samsung and Kodak both unveiled new models that have cool Wi-Fi compatibility, meaning that owners can upload and share their digital images with much less hassle than they used to face. There was also a big buzz present at CES about the ultrabook computer market, which is an area that was created thanks to the Apple MacBook Air. These new slimline computers are now available with the Windows OS and are proving popular among people who need to stay productive and connected on the move, but who don’t quite want to go as far as getting themselves a tablet. Take A Tablet  However, when it comes to computing on the go, then it’s definitely the tablet that looks set to dominate this years high-tech proceedings. Leading the way is, of course, the third incarnation of the Apple iPad. Rumours abound as to what this new device will pack inside its delicious casing, but one thing is for sure, a raft of other new tablet devices will closely follow it from all of the major manufacturers. In fact, with some 20,000 new products released at CES this year, it looks very likely that the whole electronics sector is going from strength to strength. Despite the current doom and gloom in the global economy, it seems that many of us might not have enough money for a lot of so–called ‘essentials’ but when it comes to having the latest do-it-all mobile gadgets, we’ll do pretty much whatever it takes to ensure that we get at least one of them. And, adding extra interest to this area of the marketplace, is which is going to be the operating system to dominate all of the mobile gizmo activity going on out there. Apple and its iOS may well be mighty popular, but increasingly it is the Google-developed Android OS that’s proving to be a runaway hit. Thanks to affordability and lots of user-friendly functionality, 2012 looks like being even better than last year for this platform.   This article was written by Rob Clymo.

        "title": "Top 5 Real-Time Document Collaboration Services",
        "excerpt":"It can be a major hassle to work with a group of people to complete a document or program, especially without the help of modern collaboration technology. You can try to email it back and forth among group members, share a computer, or even pass it around on a thumb drive. In recent years, companies like ThinkFree and Dropbox have made it easy to share a document online that will update whenever someone makes a change or uploads a new version, but this makes for slow progress and possible over-writing. The most revolutionary software in this field of word processing was presented in the form of a website called Etherpad. It was the first website to provide users with a quick way of creating a public document that could be edited in real-time by a group of contributors. A year after its release, Etherpad was bought out by Google. Fortunately, Google then released the software as open source, effectively allowing anyone to host and modify the original Etherpad software. This has led to a great number of little Etherpad-based document editing services to pop up around the web. Several companies have strived to make collaborating on a text document in real-time both convenient and useful. They provide their excellent online services free of charge, and are constantly improving and adding features. In this list, I present to you the greatest real-time document collaboration services from around the web.   TitanPad    Sporting the older version of Etherpad, TitanPad provides a quick and dirty way to edit your documents online. You can either create a public document with a click of a button, or sign up for a free subdomain that will let you manage your documents. The first method will limit you to eight contributors at any time, and the second will allow you an unlimited number of contributors. As far as word processing features go, you can make bold, italicized, underlined, or crossed out text. Furthermore, bullet points and indentations can be placed anywhere in the document. Because it can be confusing keeping track of multiple edits, the contributions of different people can be color coded. For ease of communication among contributors, a basic chat box is provided with any document. If you make a mistake or would like to see past revisions of a document, there is an extremely useful “Time Slider” feature that lets you go back to a document as it was at any point in time. Documents can be imported to the pad in text, HTML, Word, or RTF formats. When you are done editing, the document can be exported as an HTML page, a plain text document, a Word file, a PDF, or an OpenDocument.   QikPad    QikPad boasts the latest version of Etherpad, which was remade from the ground up since the previous version. It is both faster and cleaner. It has the same editing options as TitanPad, including text effects and a Timeslider. However, it lacks some of the impressive importing and exporting options that TitanPad supports. A tiny and extremely basic chat box can be opened from the bottom right corner, allowing for quick communication among contributors. There are also several sharing features, including embedding and a read-only document page.   Google Docs  Anyone that uses Google on a daily basis (isn’t that all of us?) has heard of Google Docs. It’s known for being an easy way to store and publish files online. It’s also great for project management because entire folders of files can be shared with hundreds of people. While being able to share new versions of a document with group members is great, sometimes it’s not very efficient. A relatively new feature of Google Docs enables users to edit Google Documents in real time with other Google Docs users. One of the most significant aspects of Google Docs is a sophisticated and highly developed editor. It provides almost anything you could ask for in an online word processor. With it, users can insert images, choose from over a dozen fonts, insert tables, and even make use of high level formatting. Google Docs isn’t just limited to a text editor. It also consists of an entire online office application suite, including a spreadsheet editor, a presentation creator, and a drawing application.  It isn’t nearly as feature-rich as Microsoft Office, but it is probably more than sufficient for basic document editing needs. Documents can be shared with up to 200 users, but can only be simultaneously edited by 50. That is a lot more than other services allow, so it is a good solution for large projects. When a document is being edited by more than one person, the names of the people editing it are shown at the top of the screen. Also, there is a collaborator chat window that all collaborators can see. Clicking on another collaborator’s name opens a private chat window. While using another service for communication isn’t much of a hassle, it is extremely convenient to be able to coordinate editing efforts with other collaborators in mere seconds.   Zoho Writer    Similar to Google Docs, Zoho offers a comprehensive suite of collaboration and productivity web applications. Among over a dozen other applications is a highly functional word processor with a friendly interface. A step up from Google Docs, it lets users utilize advanced formatting and text styling tools. Plus, it has an entire application just for managing files made in the Zoho Writer. Several other Zoho applications, including a spreadsheet creator and a slideshow creator, can be directly integrated into documents. Several years ago, Zoho announced its new real-time collaboration feature. Since then, any document that is shared among multiple people with read and write privileges can be edited by those people simultaneously. A unique aspect of this is that a document that is being collaborated on is broken up into “blocks” that can only be edited by one person at a time. Also, there is a basic commenting and chatting tool for communication between contributors. Once a document has been completed, it can be exported in a variety of formats, including Word, PDF, and HTML. Alternatively, it can be posted directly to a blog or emailed to a group of individuals.   Collabedit    Collaborating on software development can be complicated, requiring such advanced version control systems as Git and SVN. Sometimes it would be extremely helpful to be able to edit the same program at the same time. Thanks to Collabedit, you can do so without leaving the comfort of syntax highlighting. Features include a simple text editor, a document history timeline, and syntax highlighting for over a dozen programming languages. Plus, collaborators can chat with each other while they work. Another use for this service would be as a teaching and learning tool. It makes it easier to teach someone a programming language over the internet (although you are probably better off using some screen sharing software). ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Review"],

        "title": "Apple Just Announced The Third Generation iPad. Available March 16th For $499",
        "excerpt":"   After many months of rumors, Apple has finally held its first 2012 keynote. The star of the show was, of course, the fantastic new iPad. Boasting such new features as an HD Retina display and a much faster processor, it tops every other tablet on the market. Those two features alone make this upgrade noteworthy, but they are not all that was added. Resource intensive applications will run faster and crash less often with a larger helping of RAM than the iPad’s predecessors. Plus, there is an advanced new camera that will have you shooting videos and FaceTiming in sharp 1080p. The event itself was held in San Francisco on the morning of March 7th. The main speaker was Tim Cook, the fairly new CEO of Apple.  Philip Schiller, the Senior Vice President, presented the the new iPad to the world. In addition to the iPad, the Apple TV and iOS iWork and iPhoto apps were updated. You can watch the event in its entirety at the Apple website, or check out Gizmodo’s 99 second overview video here.   Beautiful Retina Display The Retina display was first introduced on the iPhone and iPod Touch last year, and it really blew us away. The quality is astounding, and you can barely make out  a pixel with a magnifying glass (let alone your naked eye). The most popular iPad rumor of all was that the new iPad would sport an HD display. Unsurprisingly, this rumor held true. The 2048 x 1536 Retina display packs a whopping 3.1 million pixels onto its notebook sized screen. If you do the math, that’s 264 pixels per inch. This makes for extremely high quality graphics that take gaming to a whole new level. Additionally, reading on the new iPad will be easier than reading on other devices due to razor-sharp text. Better resolution isn’t the only improvement to the iPad screen. Apple claims that there is a 44 percent increased color saturation on the new display that makes images more vivid, rich, and deep.      Great New Camera Narrowing the gap between tablets and digital cameras, the back-facing iSight camera now shoots 5-megapixel images and captures clear 1080p video. The new camera was engineered with a  side-illuminated sensor, an infrared filter, and a 5-element lens. This means that you will see sharper pictures and more vibrant colors. Unfortunately, Apple is eccentric with marketing and has made sure that the iPad camera doesn’t  capture pictures as well as the latest iPhone camera (which can take 8 megapixel pictures). In support  of video calling with FaceTime (does anyone actually use it?), the front-facing camera remains at the top of the iPad.      Powerful Processor And Graphics Chip Apple’s engineers work hard to make their products fast and responsive, and the iPad is no exception. The home brew A5X processor with quad-core graphics drives gives the iPad the power it needs to smoothly control the 3.1 million pixels int he Retina display. What’s more impressive is that Apple still says that the iPad battery life is 10 hours. This statistic probably assumes that you use the iPad for casual tasks like browsing the web and reading ebooks. If you were to play the new Infinity Blade: Dungeons game (also announced during the keynote) on it, I’m sure the battery would drain away within a couple of hours.   Fast 4G LTE Wireless Technology Like the iPad 2, the new iPad supports wireless network connectivity. However, it steps up its game by providing 4G LTE, which allows for up to 73Mbps download speeds. This speed is theoretical, and it is highly likely that you will frequently find yourself in an area without a high speed network. It has support for HSPA+, DC-HSDPA, CDMA, and GSM networks on both Verizon and AT&amp;T. Plus, there is the option to upgrade to a plan that lets you turn your iPad into a personal Wi-Fi hotspot. Keep in mind that buying an iPad with wireless network support will set you back an extra $100-ish dollars.   Speech-To-Text Dictation When typing out anything from a  search query to a long email, there will be an inconspicuous little  microphone button that, when tapped, will enable you to dictate what you want typed on your iPad. There is no doubt that it will make mistakes, but, since it was most likely based off of Siri technology, I bet that it will be quite accurate.      Pricing And Specifications You can analyze all of the technical specifications at Apple’s product info page, but the most significant aspects are that is weighs a mere 1.5 pounds and that it is 0.03 inches thicker (0.37 inches) than the iPad 2. Below I have composed a table that shows the pricing for the three different models of each iPad version:                         16GB Model                  32GB Model                  64GB Model                    Wi-Fi                  $499                  $599                  $699                    Wi-Fi &amp; 4G LTE                  $629                  $729                  $829        You can pre-order an iPad now, and iPads will start shipping on March 16. Those are the same prices as previous iPad models, so it&#8217;s a good deal in that respect. However, it&#8217;s a bit expensive for a tablet computer (especially when there is the alternative of a cheap netbook). It&#8217;s important to remember that one of the reasons Apple products cost so much is because they provide a lot of free customer support.   Will you be buying the new iPad? Why or why not?

        "title": "Smart TVs: Hit or Miss?",
        "excerpt":"     Smart TVs have the potential to be the big hit of the future. However, considering that currently only 40 percent of the ‘smart’ connected TVs are actually being used as intended, maybe that isn&#8217;t so likely. Adding apps to your TV sounds like a good idea in theory, but customers are finding it more difficult than expected. Yet they are still buying Smart TVs… for now.   As global economic growth continues to sputter and inflation rises, will families spend their hard-earned money on this technology? The most popular apps for Smart TVs include things like Facebook, which is a very individualized program. How will this affect TV usage? Will consumers want to check their Facebook on their TVs? Other things, like Netflix apps, have a clearer connection to the TV. It all depends on the consumer and their needs.   More things confuse the issue. The huge differences between the manufactures of TVs mean that each app has to be made-to-fit for that brand. No one-size-fits-all here. This increases the cost, complexity, and time needed for Smart TV manufacturers to really get things going. The ease of use is also a factor. Your TV remote has to be capable of everything a mouse can do, which just isn’t true. To make up for this, manufactures have to re-invent what consumers see online. It has to seem familiar while still giving the customers the ability to control it simply by remote. Not an easy task.   This is where commitment comes in. Will the TV manufactures, big names like Samsung, LG, Panasonic, want to deeply invest their money in this new technology? Or will the find a different new technology to invest in? Much of this is up to the consumer. After all, you can only sell what the consumer will buy.   Smart TVs may very well be the next big hit. Fully integrating your online experience with a big screen TV sounds like a great idea. But is it practical? Will TV manufacturers be able to successfully pull it off? And, if they do, will the consumers go for it? Only time will tell.

        "title": "Facebook to Buy Social Photo-Sharing App Instagram For a Cool Billion",
        "excerpt":" Early Monday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg announced via a wall post that Facebook has decided to buy the rapidly growing social photo-sharing app Instagram. The selling price is a whopping $1 billion in stocks and cash, equaling about $76 million per employee, or $33 for each user. This does not come as a large surprise; Facebook has a history of buying smaller startups and has been working on their own iPhone photo-sharing app for quite some time now. Additionally, Facebook has made a previous attempt to buy Instagram, but they were turned down. However, this is a first for Facebook in that they usually buy much smaller companies, and they buy them for the talent of the people that work at them. Instagram already has a shocking 30 million users, most of which are on iOS. It was just recently released for Android devices, which gives it a much larger potential user base. No other company has managed to be a worthy competitor for this popular app, and it is likely that Facebook decided that, since they had little chance of beating them, they might as well join them. Time and time again, companies have purchased popular services only to ruin them within a couple of months. They can be poorly redesigned, over commercialized, or even shut down. Fortunately, Zuckerburg promised that they are going to “be mindful about keeping and building on Instagram’s strengths and features rather than just trying to integrate everything into Facebook.” Even if Facebook were to redesign it, it would no doubt compare the gorgeous new Photo Viewer and Timeline. Facebook has been struggling to have a strong and favorable presence on mobile devices, but their apps are lousy (especially their photo sharing designs) and their competitors are better. Instagram is dominating the mobile social network niche, and this would put Facebook back in the game. Prior to this announcement, it was estimated that Instagram was worth around $500 million. Like early Facebook, it has no direct way of making money. The acquisition has been set to be made later this quarter. ","categories": ["Hot News","Social Networking"],

        "title": "What Happens to My Old Computer When I Throw it Away?",
        "excerpt":"   While ‘being green’ is becoming one of the newest and most popular trends for companies, most consumers are bucking the trend. Many people wonder what happens to their electronics once they toss them in the garbage bin, and it’s probably much more complicated than you think. In third world countries there are towns and villages dedicated to the scrapping and resurrection of our trashed electronics. The reason that there are towns revolving around this electronic trash economy is because it provides these people with a means of income. This, however, comes at a price. First thing is first, how do all these electronics make their way to the inlands of Indian and Asian countries? It is mainly through exporting by the large global companies. These shipments are received and taken to several distribution points; most communities propped up by this electronic opportunity are extremely impoverished and dangerous. When brought into these communities, they are salvaged by the locals who start to burn the metals through a chemical process which produces toxic fumes and breaks down the bodies of many once healthy individuals. The metals they are looking to salvage are the trace amounts of gold and silver that were used in the production of these electronic circuit boards. This very dangerous job is only compounded by their surrounding area and lack of proper equipment and education on the hazards of dealing with the thick black fumes emitted from the burning debris. However there are many “computer districts” in impoverished countries, where the used and refurbished computer is king. These districts are well known for their cheap computers bringing a sense of affordability to peoples of little means. There is no frowning upon the rampant computer piracy, as it is seen to the locals as normal as anything else. Since this is a field that does require not much skill, in terms of the assembly and disassembly of computers, there can be rampant competition in these parts. Thus the entire economy as a whole is in a fragile balance of give and take because vendors are located right next to each other. The saddest part of all this is the children that are brought up in this way of life. Thinking of nothing save for going out to the local scrap yards, many times located within a short walking distance from their house, and getting on their hands and knees. They grab circuit boards and begin to tear away the metal by hand. In a single round of work they can, with great effort, strip away the precious metals that they seek only to come home and brew a stew of metal. Cuts are frequent, so are burns, and so is the illness of health. There is little support provided by the government, and local health professionals are far and few between. Since there is very little in terms of education, with information being a scarcity, you will find the at most do not understand that they are slowly poisoning themselves and their potential offspring by pursuing this method of life. What can you do to prevent your computer from ending up at a place such as this? Unfortunately, not much. Unless you can personally track and follow the movements of your discarded computer, there is very little certainty about its final destination. A lot of times, these “Green” computer recycling companies’ sole intention is to export all the junk they collect. Which, in turn, they sell to the person willing to pay the most for it. And then the circle of life continues, and you may have just contributed to it. However disconcerting this may be, life does go on and until the government decides to step in, very little in reform will be enacted.   Thank you for reading! I hope I have made you more aware about the sad truth of our electronic waste. Please visit me at the USA Computer Store in Broward Florida!

        "excerpt":" Like super heroes, all E-readers have an annoying weakness. For the iPad, it’s the intense glare that makes it hopeless to read under the wrath of sunlight. For the Nook and the Kindle, it’s the darkness that makes text illegible. B&amp;N engineers have found a solution to this problem for Nooks, and it comes in the form of a front-lit screen. The B&amp;N Nook Simple Touch With GlowLight is the same as any other model of Nook, but when the “N” button it pressed, GlowLight is activated and the screen is lit up. As would be expected, there is a simple brightness setting that allows you to set the lighting to anywhere from a dim glow to a bright white. If the light is used frequently, B&amp;N claims that the Nook can last up to a month on a single charge (two months without the GlowLight). The few people lucky enough to test the device have said that it emits an even and pleasant glow that is easy on the eyes. B&amp;N is using this as a selling point, explaining that it’s “perfect for bedtime reading” because it doesn’t keep your partner awake and it makes reading in the dark enjoyable. Understandably, this model is more costly than previous Nooks, and will set you back $139. That’s 40 bucks more than the $99 kindle Touch WiFi e-reader, and less than the 3G kindle Touch. You can pre-order today, but they won’t be shipped out until May. You should be able to get it in  stores by April. It is rumored that Amazon is working on adding a similar feature to its line of Kindles, but B&amp;N beat them to the punch. B&amp;N hasn’t been doing very well over the past year, and the Nook GlowLight might just give them the boost they need. ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets"],

        "title": "The Development, History, and Increased Use of Instant Messaging",
        "excerpt":" Instant messaging is one of the most popular and efficient ways for people to communicate in modern times. Many people use instant messaging services on a daily basis. These services are provided through various companies and at various costs, but many services are free or inexpensive. Development and History of Instant Messaging Instant messaging programs became somewhat popular in the 1980s and the early 1990s. These early programs used real time text. Some of the first popular instant messaging services were PowWow, ICQ, and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM). Between the 1990s and present day, instant messaging services developed rapidly. Nowadays, instant messaging services are offered worldwide and provide a variety of options to users. People can communicate via text, but most instant messaging services now offer emoticons, photo sharing options, and even video sharing options. Increased Use of Instant Messaging In present times, instant messaging goes way beyond a computer screen and internet connection. People can now instant message directly from their phones through services such as Blackberry.com instant messaging. Users can simply download a free or inexpensive instant messaging application directly to their smart phone, and they can immediately begin communicating with others. Smart phones and some non-smart phones can host instant messaging services, but the services vary by phone and by wireless service provider. Most social networks also have a built in instant messaging feature. Some of these networks include Facebook, MySpace, and dating websites such as OK Cupid. Certain email services such as Gmail and Yahoo! offer built in instant messaging services, too. Instant Messaging for Business Purposes In addition to being used for social purposes, instant messaging is now used for many business related services. Business persons can download instant messaging to their phones, and can use them to stay in touch with colleagues and clients. Certain companies offer instant messaging archiving and security features specifically for business related purposes.

        "title": "MIT &#8220;Hack&#8221; Wars",
        "excerpt":"The term “hack” is an over glorified term for pranking used by the two most prolific technology schools in the country. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has a long history of pranking, or “hacking” (when in Rome/Cambridge…) pretty much every school with an outstanding reputation. Their stunts are generally technologically advanced and involve pranks that require the brightest in the country to pull off, such as stealing a cannon from Caltech or transforming John Harvard statue into Master Chief. Here are three “hacks” I found to be particularly amusing. 1. Caltech vs. MIT This “hack” could perhaps be my favorite. Outside the Fleming House at Caltech, a Franco-Prussian War cannon resides. In 2006, several MIT students came to Pasadena posing as a moving company.           Franco-Prussian War Cannon   They were able to procure the cannon and escape back to Cambridge with the 3,400 pound cannon. Fortunately, the Pasadena students were able to recover the cannon. The following year, the Pasadena students took their revenge by hacking The Tech, MIT’s student-run newspaper. They replaced the articles with pro-Caltech propaganda as well as satirical and ridiculous articles. You can read the newspaper here. 2. Harvard vs. MIT MIT and Harvard are always duking it out for Cambridge’s fresh water supply, the Charles River. Students at MIT enjoy pestering events at Harvard such as the holy “Harvard-Yale Football Game.” In 1982, MIT students engineered a balloon to inflate in the middle of the football field. The balloon read “MIT” and was filled with powder. It eventually exploded.      Another MIT pranks on Harvard is the redecoration of the John Harvard statue (for you Harvard enthusiasts, we know it&#8217;s not John Harvard though it is supposed to represent him&#8230;.)           John \"Master Chief\" Harvard     Don&#8217;t worry though, Harvard got their revenge by hacking MIT&#8217;s homepage and stating that the university had been purchased by Disney.           Purchased by Disney         3. MIT vs MIT           Those restless MIT hooligans feel a need to prank, whether it be themselves or other universities. When they aren&#8217;t harassing their neighbors, they are generally messing with the Great Dome or putting a living room on the ceiling. Here are several of the pranks by MIT students against the MIT campus.           R2-D2 Dome                         R2-D2 Dome               Inverted Ceiling                         They put a living room type deal outside the Media Center               Tetris Building                         Pretty Spectacular               &nbsp;           If you decide to go to college, or attend college, be sure to &#8220;hack&#8221; your neighboring colleges (I mean, who even studies in college?). Hope these serve as some sort of inspiration.    ","categories": ["How To"],

        "title": "Ultrabooks: A Hit Or A Miss?",
        "excerpt":"                 Today, ultrabook is the hottest new term in the laptop market. The term was initially created by Intel and inspired by the sleek MacBook Air, and ultrabooks are being marketed as a new generation of thin, light, powerful and design-focused laptops. Characterized by a low-power Intel Sandy Bridge processor and Intel integrated graphics, these ultrabooks try to strike a balance between powerful performance and a low price. They are designed to offer stiff competition to the ARM-based tablets. However, before you make a purchase decision, it is important to consider your needs and budget.   Ultrabooks are designed for users who value compact yet powerful performance. Ultrabooks can be an attractive option for business executives, students and other professionals because it is a thin, light, Windows laptop usually priced under $1000. Ultrabooks offer longer battery times, and are great for business travelers and young people always on the move. However, the user will have to sacrifice DVD burners, multiple USB, HDMI, and hard-wired Ethernet ports. To keep up with the latest craze, several top manufacturers like Samsung, Asus, HP, Toshiba and Lenovo are offering these ultrabooks. For example, the The HP Folio 13 Core i5 1.6GHz Ultrabook is available for under $800 on HP promotion code. There is a certain degree of crossover in the functionality of iPad, netbooks and Ultrabooks. However, the three machines represent a very different user experience and should be chosen depending on your needs. Compared to a netbook and Apple’s iPad, ultrabooks deliver powerful performance, but cost more depending on the specifications and accessories. While ultrabooks offer superior performance as compared to a netbook, the Apple’s iPad is a great device for basic web browsing, gaming and office work. Ultrabooks deliver sufficient performance for most work, entertainment and multimedia activities. However, it should not be considered for serious gaming, professional video rendering or audio conversions. Yet, the overall benefits offered by ultrabooks in terms of power, ease of use and price may result in their market success. Ultrabooks could be the future of laptops. Ultrabooks are likely to become popular among users who prefer ease of use, beautiful design and portability of their machine. Delivering superior performance at a mid-range price, the ultrabooks could be a good option for travelers. However, some other users would be willing to compromise on the design and instead opt for laptops with faster components and enhanced functionality. The purchase decision would primarily depend on the needs of a user and budget. In the future, most manufacturers will strive hard to offer ultrabooks at prices lower than $1000. With advancement in technology, it can be expected that processors and components delivering superior performance are combined together to produce laptops at lower prices. All laptops would then be expected to offer aesthetic looks and greater portability. This means that the concept of ultrabook is here to stay and will be further explored by the computer manufacturers. Will the ultrabooks win their battle against tablets like iPad?     Donna Hays is a freelance writer on topics related to the latest gadgets and consumer devices. ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets"],

        "title": "Leap Motion Unveiled a Motion Sensitive Computer Controller",
        "excerpt":"     Previously unheard of San Francisco startup company Leap Motion unveiled their blockbuster product yesterday, and it is amazing. They have developed a little black box (about the size of a thumb drive) that is capable of tracking hand gestures within a four cubic foot area. It then uses these hand gestures to control control computer applications.   Motion tracking technology has been around for several years now, and is most notably used in the Microsoft Kinect. Likewise, the concept and use of hand gestures controlling computers is nothing new. Apple, for example, has implemented gesture controls on its laptop track pads and mobile devices such as the iPad. Two things make the Leap stand out, though. For one, Leap Motion claims that the Leap can track movement to 1/100th of a millimeter. This is roughly 2oo times more accurate than any other public technology. Secondly, it is a unique blend of the previously mentioned two technologies, and each of them has proven extremely popular.   Surprisingly, the device is going for a relatively cheap, and definitely affordable, $69.99. This will almost definitely help it become popular among consumers and developers alike.   Leap motion has created an SDK that will allow software developers to create applications, including games and 3D modeling programs, that are compatible with Leap. This would suggest that it doesn&#8217;t provide native operating system and software support, but that&#8217;s only partly true. Some basic scrolling and clicking has been implemented. However, it still doesn&#8217;t provide advanced controls for applications that are even remotely complicated. This limits its possible uses significantly. But let&#8217;s not focus on it&#8217;s shortcomings; an SDK will certainly allow developers to create some awesome innovative applications that wouldn&#8217;t be possible without it.   Although it is demoed on a Mac, it is designed for Windows 7 machines. As I mentioned before, some basic touchscreen style gestures allow for simple navigation. With it&#8217;s pinpoint accuracy, it is able to use finger gestures to control software. Yet another useful feature is the ability to recognize objects that aren&#8217;t hands or fingers, such as a pencil, and interpret and implement the object gestures accordingly.   Linux, Windows8, and Mac support is said to be in the works, and it will hopefully be released at a point near in the future.   Up to this point, only computer control has been discussed. Leap Motion says that they plan to use their technology in many other kinds of devices, including cell phones, refrigerators, and even cars. Imagine  controlling your car stereo or window wipers with the swipe or clench of your hand!   Leap isn&#8217;t available just yet, but Leap Motion is taking pre-orders from their website now, and pre-orders are going to be shipped at some point during the winter of 2012. If you are a developer, you can request early acces to the device and its API through their website.    ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets","Hot News"],

        "title": "Yahoo! Gets Into the Browser Business With Yahoo! Axis",
        "excerpt":"In recent years, Yahoo has been struggling to keep up with other companies, like Google, that are immensely popular and widely used. It has made a couple of brave attempts at developing new products, but most of them have failed or been foolishly shut down. Yet again, Yahoo has released a product that they hope will bring them back into the search engine game.    It has been generally accepted that  there are three main internet browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Starting now, a new browser is going to be available that will rival those that came before it. Earlier today Yahoo announced and released its new service. Dubbed “Axis“,  it is a web browser that offers a unique browsing experience. Its core feature is a search bar and search results that act as part of the currently viewed page. It essentially allows you to skip the search results page of a normal search engine and jump between websites relevant to your search term. That’s a bit of an overstatement though. A horizontal list of large graphical thumbnails can be viewed at the bottom of each page while searching, and it will probably be the most common way users will view and select search results. While viewing any page, even one not related to your search, you can click arrows on the right and left sides of each page that will navigate through the pages that were found as search results of the most recently submitted term. While viewing search results, or any web page for that matter, a star next to the search bar can be clicked. This will allow you to add the web page to a folder (e.g. “Favorites” or “Read Later”). A personalized homepage feature is also offered, but it isn’t the default homepage, and it’s more of a way to view your saved pages.           Axis is available as an iOS app   It’s not really fair to call Axis a full out browser.  It is actually available as a plug-in or extension for the browsers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer. It is also available as an iPhone or iPad app (in which case it is a complete web browser). I played around with the iPhone app for a bit, and I have to say that I am quite impressed! Although it has been made possible by other services and plugins before, I am delighted to find that Axis supports bookmarking syncing across devices (assuming you have a Yahoo account). It is not clear yet whether or not Yahoo plans to release their browser for Android. The most annoying aspect of Axis is that the search bar isn’t integrated into the browser very well. It overlays the bottom left corner of the screen, covering up text and making it impossible to click on anything that is on the bottom left corner of a web page. The overall experience would be greatly improved if the search bar and other features were directly integrated into the default search/menu bar. As of now, there are no ads in search results or user interface elements. It would seem that Yahoo is wisely trying to provide the best experience possible until Axis has gained a loyal following. It will need this edge in order to have a chance in the market where so many others have failed. Yahoo still has a user base of 700 million people, and 80 million of them receive Internet Explorer software packages from Yahoo that include their old toolbar (yuck). It definitely has enough users to make this a popular product. Plus, Axis is actually a pretty cool service. Install Axis and tell us what you think about it! ","categories": ["Browser","Hot News"],

        "title": "The Five Best Alarm Clock Apps for Android",
        "excerpt":"Smartphones are great for many things, and one great use of your smartphone is as an alarm clock. Smartphones make great alarm clocks because they are always with you, and have all kinds of hardware features that allow them to be especially good at waking you up. This article covers the five best alarm clock apps for Android phones. Alarm Clock Plus This app has a great interface, and it includes a home shortcut, a photo slideshow feature, countdown timers, and a handy snooze feature. The snooze feature requires you to solve a math problem before it will silence the alarm. This is great because your option is to wake up enough to solve the problem, which by then you are mostly awake anyway, or tear the battery out of the phone, which is a pretty extreme solution. There is also a free ad supported version. AlarmDroid    This alarm app is one of the better ones available for Android. It is simple and feature packed. It has a talking alarm clock feature that informs you of the weather and the time as an alarm. It also has a robust scheduling system. The app comes with a widget that counts down your next alarm. There is a free version and a paid version.  I Can’t Wake Up This is a great alarm clock app as well. While this app also features math problem alarm dismissal, you can also choose number ordering, memory tests, repeated patterns, and a bar code. These are sure to get you up and thinking if you want to get your alarm to switch off. You can even set more than one of these Wake Up Methods, as they call them. All of this and the app is free. Alarm Clock Xtreme This alarm has all of the features you would expect in an alarm clock app. What is unique about this app is that it adds Captcha, shake, and docking as methods of silencing the alarm. This just adds a few more options for alarm dismissal. The app also features an alarm that gradually gets louder to gently wake you, as well as a home screen widget. ElectricSleep    This app is a bit different from the others. The idea behind this app is that it uses the accelerometer in your phone to sense you movements and determine where you are in your sleep cycle. The idea is that the alarm will wake you when you are in one of the lighter stages of sleep, leaving you feeling more rested. Of course this means that you have to sleep with your phone next to your body. It is an interesting concept to say the least.   So if you haven’t considered using your Android phone as your primary alarm clock before, you may want to consider it as these feature packed apps offer functionality that a bedside clock could only dream of doing. You can even try many of these apps for free, so what are you waiting for?   +Michelle Gordon is a blogger who writes about sleep, health, and technology.

        "title": "What is LTE Internet?",
        "excerpt":" It has been long time since we needed a definition given to a form of Internet Service. We hear companies like Verizon Wireless throw around three letter acronyms all the time, and the newest one is LTE. LTE stands for Long-Term Evolution, but its entire name is “3GPP Long-Term Evolution for the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System”. This would actually be 3GPP UMTS LTE. So it is no wonder why wireless firms are marketing the service as simply LTE. Now that we know what the letters mean, what is the service all about? LTE is less of a type of Internet service and more of a standard in which wireless service can be measured. Another way to look at it would be that LTE replaces what is currently being referred to as 3G networks by T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Sprint and other internet providers. The upgrade from 3G is significant and is exemplified by the Verizon LTE service available in Dallas, Texas. This service has been up long enough to get a broad selection of data that shows definitively that the network offers consistent average downloads of 15 Mbps and an average upload speed of 1.5 Mbps. By way of example, the older Verizon 3G network had download speeds around 1 Mbps and could upload at about 0.67 Mbps. This is an enormous leap in service and it beats its competitors hands down. AT&amp;T also has an LTE offering; however it has not been in service long enough, or with a significant service load, to offer enough data to make any determinations on average speeds. So what does LTE really mean for wireless customers? Remember ads showing iPhone users browsing the Internet while they had a conversation on the same phone? While it is true that this is possible, have you ever tried it? On a 3G network it is absolutely possible to do this, but after having tried it I couldn’t recommend it to anyone. The bandwidth on 3G networks that is available to users is simply too narrow to actually enjoy web surfing while on a call. For myself, I would say that I don’t enjoy web browsing on my 3G network at all. LTE will change all of this. It is 15 times faster than the 3G network. How Does LTE Work? One secret behind the massive technological leap being made by LTE is the use of two separate interfaces, one for uploads and one for downloads.  By using separate connections the service can optimize each differently to offer the best service going both ways. For uploads LTE utilizes, get ready for it, Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access or DFTS-OFDMA.  This is a mouthful, and if you want to know more about this scheme you can visit the Wiley Library and read their PDF report here.  The article is so technical that even I had a hard time getting through it, so I will summarize what I think is important.  The upload scheme of DFT-OFDMA allows the carrier to accept an upload source that is far weaker than the download source.  The speed at which data is transferred is, of course, greatly reduced, but so are the power requirements.  Imagine if you phone had to send a signal to a wireless tower with the same strength that the tower was sending a signal to your phone.  With this “dual channel” set up the data streams can be configured in various ways to make up for the power differential without lowering service quality.  In a nutshell, your battery will last much longer. LTE downlinks use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access or OFDMA. This interface is very different from the wireless connections that have been used since the late 1980’s.  In fact, the more advanced networks that predate LTE are simply more powerful versions of the same old architecture.  OFDMA requires that a “smart antennae” technology called MIMO be used.  This is Multiple Input Multiple Output and it allows for more than one connection from a single device.  It makes sense that if your phone was using 3 simultaneous connections to a network that it would be faster and more stable.  This is the same technology that wireless routers use now and also shatters the future limitations of bandwidth available to consumers.  Imagine if the only limitation in upload and download speeds were the device being used. LTE can be confusing, and with its current limited deployment not much is being done to raise public awareness of how revolutionary the service really is.  As the big companies such as Verizon and AT&amp;T begin to aggressively roll this offering out we will begin to hear and learn more.  For now, LTE is the best public offering of wireless internet or phone service on the market.

        "title": "How To Solve Issues Related To Installation of Drivers on Windows XP",
        "excerpt":"   Installing drivers is the first thing to do after installing an operating system on your computer. While most of the people now use Windows 7, there are still many computer users who work on Windows XP. The operating system is fine, but the problem occurs with drivers. There are many drivers in the market which are superior to the existing drivers of Windows XP. Many are even better quality and can be easily downloaded from the Internet. The main problem related to drivers occurs when you try to install audio drivers on Windows XP SP 3. The cause of the problem is that Windows XP service pack 3 gives priority to Microsoft’s HD audio driver. As a result, it decides that Microsoft’s HD audio driver is superior to others and does not let you install drivers from any other manufacturer. Audio drivers are necessary for any computer or laptop. You just can not do without them. The problem mentioned here mostly occurs with Realtek drivers. If you are facing such a problem, you may simply uninstall and reinstall the drivers. However, there is a chance that this might not give you any positive result. In such a situation, there are other options or steps that you may follow. Steps to Install Realtek drivers 1) If the drivers you installed are not working, make sure to restart your computer. But restart the machine in safe mode this time. 2) Once the computer starts working, Go to “My computer” and click on properties. Now click on device manager. 3) Go to the option named sound, video, and game controllers. You will see an option “Realtek HD audio device”. Right click and disable this option. 4) Now go to system devices and disable the device which is named Microsoft UAA bus drivers for HD audio. These are drivers which are pre installed by Microsoft and are considered to be superior by Windows XP service pack 3. 5) Now restart your computer or laptop. Remember to restart again in safe mode. 6) Follow the second step and open device manager. Go to system devices and once again look for Microsoft UAA bus drivers for HD audio. Now uninstall this driver from your computer or laptop. Doing this will also uninstall the Realtek HD audio from your computer. 7) Also install the device named Legacy audio drivers. You will find this option in sound, video and game controllers. 8) Again restart your computer or laptop. This time, run it in standard mode and not in safe mode. Remember to cancel Add/Remove hardware wizard. 9) You can now simply install Realtek audio driver from the CD. If you do not have the CD, you may log on to the manufacturer’s official website or search for the drivers on the Internet. Make sure that you restart your computer once the installation of the driver is complete. These steps should be able to resolve the whole issue related to installation of drivers on Windows XP. You can simply follow the same steps to install other drivers. Add or remove appropriate drivers that you are trying to install. ","categories": ["Windows"],

        "title": "How Night Vision Works",
        "excerpt":"Watch any action movie and there is sure to be a scene where some soldier or cop is stuck facing the enemy in the dark and lo and behold he just happens to have night vision goggles that let him see perfectly and win the fight. Or maybe it is the bad guys who have the night vision and the resourceful hero turns the lights on and blinds them. We are all familiar with how night vision works in the movies; the question is how does it work in reality? Can night vision allow you to see even in pitch dark? Read on to learn how night vision works.    Light vs. Heat  To understand how night vision works it is important to understand the difference between light and heat. What people typically think of as night vision really encompasses two separate technologies; light amplification and thermal detectors. Night vision works by amplifying existing light and projecting the image on a screen for a person to view. Thermal imaging works by picking up light released by warm objects and projecting it on a screen to be viewed. Night Vision The visible light spectrum that the human eye can see is right in the middle of the entire spectrum of existing light. On the low end of the light spectrum is infrared light. This type of light is further divided into three different sub sections: near-infrared, mid-infrared, and thermal infrared. Night Vision Devices (NVDs) capture the near and mid infrared light and send it through a lens. Light is made up of particles called photons. Inside the NVD, these photons are sent through glass tubes that are made using fiber optic technology. The photons first pass through a filter that converts them into electrons. When these electrons pass through the glass tubes, they crash against the walls and create more electrons. This results in far more electrons coming out of the tubes than entered. These electrons are still in the same positions; it is just that there are more of them. These multiplied electrons then pass through another filter that turns them back into photons. These photons are read and then converted into electrical signal that produce an image on a screen. The result is the image shows much more information that can be viewed by the naked eye. The image has a green tint as a result of the process. Thermal Vision Thermal vision also works by detecting infrared light but not infrared light being reflected by objects in the environment. Thermal imaging devices capture the thermal infrared that is emitted by all warm objects. Basically, all objects are made up of atoms, and these atoms are always in motion. That motion gives off energy in the form of heat. Thermal imaging devices detect that infrared light and convert the greater amounts into white colors and low levels into dark colors. The result on a screen is that warm objects such as humans are light colored and the inanimate objects around them are darker. Using this technology, it is easy to see if a person (warm) very far away is holding a gun (cool). So it turns out that you really can see in the dark using night vision technology. And thermal imaging can show the difference between cool and warm objects even in complete darkness. This technology has been put in rifle scopes, binoculars, goggles, and cameras. For once Hollywood really was not exaggerating.     Author bio: Craig Pearson is an avid hunter, outdoorsman, and adventurist.

The most significant announcements included an update to the MacBook Pro and the release of iOS 6. Additionally, Apple shared some new features that will be in Mac OS X Mountain Lion when it is available this July. Overall, this year’s keynote was very impressive and information packed. If you want to watch the entire two hour presentation, you can view it here. After the comedic Siri opening, Tim Cook jumps to describing some astonishing statistics about the app store. To date, 650,000 apps have been created for the app store, and 225,000 of those were made specifically for the iPad. Plus, over 400 million app store accounts have been created, having collectively downloaded over 30 billion apps. The MacBook Air received some minor updates. The camera has been replaced with the same 720p HD camera that is in the MacBook Pro, USB 3 and Thunderbolt are now supported, the flash storage is now up to 4 times faster and can store up to 512GB of data, the old processors have been replaced with Intel’s i5 and i7 processors (effectively enabling 60 percent faster HD graphics), and up to 8GB of memory can be installed. All models are $100 cheaper than their predecessors, and they are already available. Perhaps the most extreme and controversial update was that of the MacBook Pro. The original models that have been around for several years are still available. They have received the same hardware updates as the MacBook Air, with the addition of G3Force GT 650M graphics for the 15-inch MacBook model that allow for 1GB of video memory and 60% faster discrete graphics. It has been available for purchase since Monday.    An entirely new model of MacBook Pro, referred to as “The Next Generation MacBook Pro”, was also introduced. At 0.71 inches, it is extremely thin. It weighs in at a mere 4.46 pounds, making it ideal for mobile usage. Surprisingly, the new MacBook Pro boasts a retina display, just like the ones on the latest iPads and iPhones. It crams four times the amount of pixels into the same amount of space! Mountain Lion and and all of its default applications, such as iPhoto, have been updated to take advantage of this new display. It is worth noting, however, that not all graphics are made for such a screen, making it’s usage slightly limited. That’s not the only update to the screen, though. It has a wider viewing angle, and glare has been reduced by almost 75 percent. The insides of the new MacBook Pro have been reworked both to fit in such a small space and to make it a more powerful machine. It can be configured with up to 16GB of memory, the next-generation Kepler graphics, and up to 768GB of flash storage. Even with all of these resource demanding features, the battery can last up to 7 hours on a single charge. The ports on the side include an HDMI port, a USB 3 port, and a Thunderbolt port.    Mac OS X Mountain Lion has been around for a while now, but it is only available to developers. Since it is still in development, new features and bug fixes are being added all the time. Some of the greatest new features that were described during the keynote include built in iCloud support for a large variety of apps, a notification center (just like the iOS one) that can hook into all applications, a built in speech to text dictation utility (like on the iPad), a share button that appears in various places around the operating system, a new Safari that syncs tabs across devices and has a bar that unifies the URL and search fields, a Power Nap application that keeps the Mac up to date while it sleeps, a 1080p Airplay screen mirroring utility, and a built in Game Center application for the Mac. Mountain Lion will be available in July for $19.99.  The next major version of Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS 6, was revealed, and it sports a handful of cool new features. For one, Siri can now answer questions about sports, restaurants, movies. Also, Siri can launch apps with a quick command. In a partnership with several car companies, Siri will be accessible through a button on the steering wheel that controls the iPhone. Greater language support is provided, and Siri can now be used in French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Mandoren, and Cantonese. iPad users will be able to use Siri in iOS 6. Like Twitter integration in iOS 5, iOS 6 will officially support Facebook integration. Posting content to Facebook from both built-in apps and 3rd party apps can be done with the push of a button. Additionally, both Notification Center and Siri will recognize and integrate Facebook. The default phone app on the iPhone has a few more enhancements. From the homescreen, incoming calls can be declined or replied to via a text. If the call is declined, the phone app will remind you later to call them back. In the settings menu, a new option, Do Not Disturb, is available. It will enable users to turn off all or most notifications. FaceTime will be possible over cellular networks. Plus, FaceTime calls to your phone number can be answered from any FaceTime enabled device. Mobile Safari will support synced tabs and an offline reading list. In a major functionality leap, javascript image uploaders will now function in Safari. On websites that also have a native app, a banner will slide down alerting the user of that app. Fullscreen support will be available with the tap of a button while viewing a web page in landscape mode. Photos from the photos app can be shared with friends through shared photo streams that appear as new albums. These photo streams can be viewed across all devices. Contacts can be marked as VIPs, and notifications, emails, and texts are all marked with a VIP badge. In the mail app, photos and videos can easily be inserted into composed emails. An entirely new app was developed for iOS 6 called Passbook. Passbook organizes tickets and passes for a large variety of services and supported apps, and notifies users when those tickets should be used. iOS 6 will feature a lot of new accessibility features. The most useful one is called Guided Access, and it allows people to turn off parts of an app so that disabled people don’t accidentally tap them and leave the app. The Maps app has been recreated from the ground up. It no longer uses Google’s mapping data; Apple has created their own mapping service. It has features like business and traffic information. Most significantly, turn by turn navigation has been implemented. It acts as an elegant and extremely intelligent GPS that uses Siri for controls. While viewing maps, 3D models of major cities can be viewed and navigated through. What’s your take on this year’s WWDC? Will you be buying and using any of these new products? Why or why not?

        "title": "iOS 6 Boasts Some Awesome New Features",
        "excerpt":"     The next version of Apple&#8217;s mobile operating system, iOS, was announced at this year&#8217;s WWDC, and it introduces over 200 new features to the platform. In case you are not familiar with the term, iOS is the operating system that runs on Apple&#8217;s popular lines of iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads. Apple updates iOS roughly every year, and they never cease to find elegant ways of improving users&#8217; mobile experiences. This year is no exception.      Siri has been upgraded to understand questions related to sports. It can display both college and major league game scores, as well as the statistics of individual players. If you ask it about restaurants, Siri will provide ratings, reviews, and descriptions of nearby eateries. Additionally, Apple has partnered with OpenTable to allow for in-app reservations. Those of you that go to movie theaters frequently will be glad to hear that Siri can provide lists of currently playing movies and their descriptions. Ratings and reviews from Rotton Tomatoes are available from within the Siri interface. In my opinion, the greatest update to Siri is the ability to launch apps with a voice command. Just say &#8220;Open Angry Birds&#8221; and you will be instantly switched to Angry Birds. In iOS 5, siri was capable of texting dictation. iOS 6 expands on that and allows for Twitter Tweet and Facebook post dictation.   The largest update to Siri was made with the cooperation of major car companies. In new models of some cars, a button will be installed on the steering wheel that, when pressed, activates siri on a plugged-in iPhone. It allows for effective eyes free interaction with the iPhone.   The new version of Siri will work with the French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Mandoren, and Cantonese languages. This is sure to make it more popular in the countries where these languages are most commonly spoken. Included with this additional language support is Siri location recommendations (restaurants, movie theaters, etc.) for countries outside of the United States.   The iPad 3 has had excellent speech to text functionality since its release in March, but there was no sign of Siri to be found. iOS 6 will bring Siri to the iPad platform, making awkward typing on the iPad&#8217;s medium sized keyboard even even more unnecessary.      Like Twitter integration in iOS 5, Facebook will be directly integrated into iOS 6 with settings that allow for single sign-on and simple sharing. Once you have logged into Facebook through the settings page, all apps can, with your permission, use your account to grab content, upload media, or submit a post. In the Photo app, you will be able to tap the share button and have the option of sharing to Facebook or Twitter. Likewise, pages in Safari can by shared on your wall with the press of a button. While using the new maps app, you will be able to share a location or section of a map with all of your Facebook friends. On app pages in the app store, song and album pages in the iTunes store, and game pages in Game Center, there will be a new &#8220;Like&#8221; button for sharing to Facebook. And, just like Facebook widgets and wall posts on the internet, you will be able to see which of your friends have liked certain apps.   The most useful and accessible Facebook share buttons can be found right inside of the slide-in notification center window. Plus, Siri will respond to requests to post messages to Facebook.   Apple will provide an API for developers that will allow them to include the Facebook share feature from within their app. In the past, developers had to open a sloppy web page within their app or hook into the official Facebook app in order to enable users to quickly post content to Facebook.   Contact information collecting and syncing can be a nightmare. Fortunately, your contact link will update itself with all of the contact information of your friends on Facebook. Similarly, Facebook events and birthdays will appear in the default iOS calendar app.      The Phone app has been updated to allow for more control over an incoming call right from the lock screen. As you can see in the image above, swiping up from the bottom of the screen during an incoming call alert will provide several options. You can choose to hit the usual decline or accept buttons, or you can reply with a text message or be reminded later. Tapping either the &#8220;reply with message&#8221; button or the &#8220;remind me later&#8221; button will reveal a list of options for default messages or reminders. The &#8220;remind me later&#8221; options are especially cool in that you can choose to be reminded when you leave from or arrive at a certain area.      Airplane mode is very useful for quickly and easily  disabling your internet connection. It effectively stops notifications and incoming messages. There is also a setting in the notifications page for disabling all notifications. However, there is currently no way to quickly retrieve and allow incoming data while disabling the notifications and alerts that they would normally cause. Thankfully, a new setting called &#8220;Do Not Disturb&#8221; will do just that. Do Not Disturb will also allow certain special calls or alerts to leak through if you allow them to. For example, you can choose to only receive phone calls from a particular group of important contacts.   The Jailbroken community has been enjoying FaceTime calls over their cellular connection since its release, but not Apple will provide official support for FaceTime over your cellular connection. Also, if somebody calls your cell phone number using FaceTime you will be able to answer that cal on any FaceTime enabled device. The same will go for iMessage messages.      The Mobile Safari app in iOS 6 has several new features as well. The first of which is &#8220;iCloud Tabs&#8221;. Tapping the iCloud Tabs button in Safari will reveal a list of all of the currently opened tabs on all of your shared iCloud enabled devices. Also, any web page can be saved for offline viewing in a reading list. This feature will kill dozens of apps, like Get Pocket (Read it Later), that have provided this functionality for years. Additionally, Apple has acknowledged the success of other browser apps and applied their full screen feature to Mobile Safari.   Many popular online websites also have iOS apps, and, until now, they are either forgotten or overly advertised in the form of pop-ups or annoying splash pages.The Mobile Safari app in iOS 6 will check to see if websites also have an iOS app, and, if they do, a fancy banner will slide down from the top of the page alerting you of the apps existence. If you already have the app installed, you will see a button that will take you to that app in the same state as you were on the website.   Most online forms work in Mobile Safari, but one kind of form that has (understandably) never worked is the file uploader. In the new version of Mobile Safari, tapping on an image upload button in a web page will reveal a window of photos from your photo library. Theses photos can then be selected and uploaded to the website.      The default photo app now supports shared photo streams. That means that you can select photos from your library and then send them to friends of your choice. The friend that receives the photos will have them in an album in their library, and they will be able to leave comments on the shared photos. All of your shared photo streams can be viewed on any internet enabled device via the official photo apps and the iCloud website.   The Mail app is great for organizing mail accounts and managing individual emails, so it&#8217;s great to hear that it has been made even better with VIP contact tags. Anyone on your contacts list can be marked as a VIP, and their emails will be received as an alert. Within the mail app, emails from them will be marked with a star. Plus, there is a VIP mailbox that includes emails from all of your VIPs. Similarly, there is a mailbox for emails that have been flagged.   In iOS 5, composing emails in the mail app that consist of anything other than text is difficult and annoying. In iOS 6, you can just tap and hold to be prompted to insert a picture or video clip from your library.      A new default app called PassBook was added to iOS 5. It basically allows you to organize and store all of your passes and tickets in one place. It also notifies you when you are in the place the ticket our pass should be used. If it is a ticket that has a set date and time when it can be used, like a movie ticket, PassBook will send you a  notification alerting you of this impending time. Each pass in PassBook has its own page that contains information about the pass as well as the pass  itself (barcode, QR code). An API is available that will enable developers to create passes from within their apps.      iOS is famous for its accessibility features and apps, and Apple knows that. They have added a major accessibility feature called Guided Access that allows people to turn off certain parts of the apps and the device in order to improve the experience of disabled people. The only problem I can see arising is that the open app can crash unexpectedly, leaving the disabled person confused and away from their app.   These accessibility features can also be used to create a single-app mode for museums and schools. It would make the iPad great for taking tests or providing information on a tour.      Apple has ditched the old Google powered maps app and created their own global mapping service from the ground up. Like Google maps, local businesses and points of interest can be shown in search results. Tapping on them reveals more information, including Yelp reviews, ratings, and photos. Traffic view can also be toggled, and it shows colors on streets that correspond to the level of traffic that is currently on that street. The traffic system uses crowd-sourced data to create its traffic diagrams.   All of the aforementioned features already existed in the old maps app, but the killer new feature is turn-by-turn navigation. Acting as an intelligent GPS, the maps app will guide you to your destination. It takes traffic into account when update its ETA and route. Siri provides support for initiating a turn-by-turn route, and it will respond to questions relating to the current route. During your drive, Siri will narrate progress and turns that have to be made. These turn-by-turn navigation features make Apple a large competitor for major GPS brands.   Most impressively, major cities will appear in 3D when navigated to in the maps app. This was made possible by capturing images from helicopters and planes while flying around the cities. While looking at a major city, you can select a 3D point of interest and turn on fly over mode to automatically circle around it. With satellite and 3D mode turned on, the maps app seriously competes with Google Earth&#8217;s awesome abilities. ","categories": ["Hot News","iOS"],

        "title": "Now You Can Develop iPhone Apps Free of Cost",
        "excerpt":"It is a great time for anyone to get their hands on the free development of iPhone apps. If you are thinking about it, remember that you would be getting an edge on the competitive market while coming up with your own masterpiece. The only thing an individual requires to develop an iPhone app is a unique and creative idea. Now, you must be wondering how you can develop your own iPhone app free of cost. Well, in this article I aim to explain the process to you.          Check Out The Developmental Tools           First and foremost, you need to check out all the vital developmental tools that are presently available in the market. You will get to know that Apple has its own official development platform that is known as the Xcode and the iOS application development kit which can be downloaded anytime and by anyone free of cost. Both of these platforms can be used by people to develop iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad apps. As a developer, you will get to have access to some powerful tools such as interface builder, instruments, iOS Simulator, Xcode IDE and many others. However, you are required to have a Mac device to develop these iOS apps, but it is not essential to have the most robust Mac system. A Mac Mini would be good enough to develop iPad or iPhone apps.           Programs Used           The Xcode platform makes use of the Objective-C programing language for the development of mobile apps. In case you are not aware of what Objective-C is, you can opt for another one called Corona that is marked as a substitute to Xcode and uses a very fundamental programming language. Furthermore, it happens to be an extremely convenient and friendly alternative for newbie’s. The biggest advantage of Corona, compared to Xcode, is that it not only supports iOS but Android development as well.           Programming is Vital           You should buy some books related to Java and C++ that will give you a better idea regarding app development and programming. You can look for books over the Internet, and even in the market, that can assist you with simple app development and getting your apps out there in a bang. You should refine your ideas and thoughts to adapt to the best iPhone practices. It is recommended to opt for such applications that are similar to your app idea so that you can easily draw out the screens. You can even make a note of aspects such as where the application went wrong, what kind of flaws it has, and how it can be improvised.           Developing a User-Interface           Developing a graphical user interface for the iPhone is totally different from developing for a PC or the web. You need to keep some vital things in mind such as existence of touch screen, lack of physical keyboard, lack of mouse, and limited screen space. You can even acquire assistance from the &#8216;iOS human interface guidelines&#8217; that can be browsed through on Apple’s developer site to get some useful techniques and tips. You can also join Apple&#8217;s developer program where you can easily submit your app to Apple by paying a small subscription free ($99), which would be valid for a year.           &nbsp;           Kady Babs is doing CCNP Wireless Certification Preparation and is a freelancer writer attached to Test4Prep, the best source for Cisco Certification Exams Preparation.

        "title": "Microsoft Announces New Surface Tablet",
        "excerpt":"     Yesterday, Microsoft held a media event  in Hollywood at which they announced a new line of tablet computers. CEO Steve Ballmer himself introduced the tablet, Surface, to the crowd of eager journalists. If you have the time, you can catch the entire 47 minute keynote  yourself here. While the unhyped event in itself is a surprise coming from Microsoft, what&#8217;s more unusual is that Microsoft developed a new product that is hardware rather than software. They clearly feel pressured and desperate.   In terms of business, the Surface rivals partner companies Hewlett Packard, Acer, and Dell. All of these companies, and many more, create the desktop computers required to run Windows. In fact, Acer and Samsung have even been making Windows tablets for years. To quote Michael Gertenberg, a consumer analyst, &#8221;This was clearly a referendum on Microsoft&#8217;s partners. Microsoft felt they could not rely on others to deliver on their vision for Windows 8 in mobile computing&#8221;. The real competition, however, is between Microsoft and Apple. The iPad easily dominates the present day tablet market, and it will make it difficult for Microsoft to gain popularity and a decent market share. However, the Surface is actually impressive enough to make consumers think twice when choosing a tablet. It combines elegance, an aspect Microsoft has only started to master in recent years, with powerful functionality.      The tablet itself comes in two flavors. The first, Surface with Windows RT, runs a slimmed down version of Windows 8 that is made for ARM processors. The touch friendly Windows mobile styled interface is the primary means of interaction, although a slimmed down version of the classic Windows desktop can be accessed  with the tap of a button. This desktop interface is only capable of running Microsoft Office applications and Internet Explorer (yuck).  As far has hardware goes, the Windows RT version of the Surface weighs in at roughly 1.5 pounds, and it is a third of an inch thick. Unlike the iPad, a USB 2.0 port, a micros slot, and a Micro HDMI port can be found on the side of the tablet. While this is great for file transferring and screen mirroring, it is important to note that the iPad provides alternate means of accomplishing the same tasks in the form of iCloud and Airplay (granted, Airplay is more of a pain than an HDMI cable). IT will come in both 32GB and 64GB models.   The second flavor is the Surface Pro. It will be Intel based with both the Metro UI and a fully functional Windows desktop. On the side of the tablet there will be a Mini Display port, a microSDXC card slot, and a USB 3.0 port. It weighs in at just under two pounds, and it is almost 0.5 inches thick. The Surface Pro will come in both 64GB and 128GB models.   Both versions of the Surface will be available for a yet to be determined price at the Windows 8 during the fall of 2012.   Microsoft has really outdone themselves with the design of the Surface. Not only does is sport a shiny widescreen display, but it also has a conveniently tucked in kickstand that can be quickly popped out (making it great for hands free usage). Plus, the magnetic cover that comes in a variety of cool colors doubles a full sized keyboard, complete with touch pad.   Cameras can be found on both the front and back of the tablet. When combined with the built in microphone, they provide a great way to engage in a casual video chat or initiate a remote meeting. Microsoft acquired Skype a while back, so it is likely that we will see heavy Skype integration within Windows 8.      Unsurprisingly, the same digital pen functionality that has been around since the release of the Tablet PC Edition of Windows is supported on the Surface Pro. It allows for writing on digital surfaces with a special pen. Markings can be zoomed and panned like the rest of the page they are on. During the demo of this pen usage, it was promised that touch sensing is disabled while writing to avoid accidental page movement. Unfortunately, it was evident that writing on a touch screen was awkward and glitchy. Either way, it has been proven time and time again that consumers prefer using fingers to pens.   There was no mention of cellular network connectivity, but for now it can be safely assumed that Wi-Fi is the only means of obtaining an online connection. I would hope, for Microsoft&#8217;s sake, that they decide to include cellular data functionality in the near future. It has become a necessity for business devices.   Well, that sums up what we know and think about the Surface. What&#8217;s your take on it? Will you be buying one? Comment! ","categories": ["Hot News","Microsoft","Windows"],

        "title": "Over 30 Billion Apps Have Been Downloaded From the App Store",
        "excerpt":"     At the WWDC last week, CEO Tim Cook announced that over 30 billion apps have been downloaded from the iOS app store since its conception in 2008. That&#8217;s 15 billion app downloads in less than a year. This shocking statistic is more comprehendible when you consider that over 400 million accounts from 120 countries have been created to date, making Apple the largest holder of credit card accounts on the internet. If you do that math, the average user has downloaded 75 apps. How do you compare to this as an Android or iOS user? I know that I have downloaded over 300 apps in the past three years alone.   Of the apps that have been downloaded, 425,000 are for the iPhone and iPod touch, while only  225,000 are specifically designed for the iPad. That means that there are over 650,000 apps in the app store. Cook claims that more than $5 billion has been paid to developers for their efforts in creating these apps.   Compared to the Android Market, currently approaching the 10 billion app download mark, the App store is significantly more popular. Analysts claim, however, that people are now adopting the Android platform at a greater rate than they are the iOS platform. Because of this, we can expect to see the Android Market slowly catch up with the iOS app store during the next couple of years.  ","categories": ["Apple","iOS"],

        "title": "Update to Spotify App Brings Free Mobile Radio",
        "excerpt":" Music streaming service Spotify recently announced that they plan to release an update for their popular iOS app that will introduce radio features. The new service will be free for iPhone, iPod, and iPad users in the United States, but only premium subscribers will have access to it in other countries (due to licensing restrictions). This concept is not a new one. Services like Pandora, Slacker, and Songza have been providing this great functionality for years. The update will make it possible for users to create radio stations based on favorite artists, albums, or playlists, and then listen to relevant songs from Spotify’s huge catalog. Like with Pandora, you can give individual songs  a thumbs up or a thumbs down and the station will adjust accordingly. If you like a particular song, you will be able to save it for later. Free users will have to endure occasional advertisements from miscellaneous car, restaurant, and cell phone providers. This ruined the experience for many Pandora users, but it’s only fair that Spotify is able to compensate musicians and make a small profit. Premium users will not only have an ad-free listening experience, but they will also have an unlimited number of song skips (free users will only have a couple). Perhaps one of the greater aspects of the desktop version of Spotify is the social network integration. After connecting your Facebook account to the Spotify app, your radio stations and favorite songs will appear in your friends’ Facebook streams. You will also be able to create radio stations using friends’ playlists. Android users out there that are fans of the music streaming service will be glad to hear that an update is also planned for the Android version of the Spotify app. It will sport all of the same features as its iOS counterpart.

        "title": "Facebook Replaced Everyone&#8217;s Email Address With @Facebook.com",
        "excerpt":" In yet another bothersome Facebook update, all account email addresses have been hidden and replaced with the the old @facebook.com addresses. Facebook has reportedly been rolling out this “feature” since last Friday. The Facebook email service was created back in November of 2010, and it allowed users to receive emails in their  Facebook Messages inbox. Perhaps the best part of this feature is that it provides email address privacy. Intended as a replacement for Gmail, it didn’t catch on. It was a rather obnoxious move in Facebook’s part to force unsuspecting people to use this grossly unpopular and out-of-date service. If you’re like most people, then you probably aren’t very happy about having your proper contact information hidden without your permission. Fortunately, there is an easy way to undo the update and put your old email address back on your profile page.   Navigate to your profile and click the “About” button.  Scroll down the About page until you see your Facebook email address. Click on “Edit”.  Click the circle to the right of the Facebook email address and select the “Hidden from Timeline” option from the drop-down menu.  To show your real email address, click the circle-backslash symbol to the right of your email address and select the “Shown on Timeline” option from the drop-down menu.  Click “Save” at the bottom of the pop-up window to save these changes.  Hopefully this change hasn&#8217;t caused too much trouble among people trying to share and retrieve each other&#8217;s contact information over the weekend!","categories": ["Email","Social Networking"],

        "title": "Google Build Brings LEGO Blocks to Chrome",
        "excerpt":"   Working with LEGO, Google Australia has developed a project called “Build” that is an online 3D LEGO simulator. It consists of a detailed Google map of New Zealand and Australia that is broken up into small 32 by 32 squares of LEGO brick land. Each of these plots can be edited using the built in lego construction interface, and then they can be submitted for approval (most are accepted). Once a plot of land has been accepted, your creation will be visible to anyone that views the map and you can share the location of your creation via email or Google+. So far, 12 kinds of LEGO blocks are available for use, and they each come in 10 different colors. Additionally, there are special door and window blocks for adding detail to buildings. That should give you enough to relive those childhood memories and show off your creativity to the world! The Build map will only cover Australia and New Zealand for now, but there are plans to expand the map to include other countries in the near future. This will not prevent you from trying the web app from an unsupported country though. The Google team explained the development processes in a blog post:   Build may look simple, but this collaborative 3D building experience would not have been possible a couple of years ago. It shows how far browser technology has come and how the web is an amazing platform for creativity. We made the bricks with WebGL, which enables powerful 3D graphics right in the browser and demonstrates the upper limit of current WebGL graphics performance. We then mixed in Google Maps (another Aussie invention) so you can put your creation in a LEGO world alongside everyone else’s. Build makes use of the new WebGL technology that is currently only available in Chrome and the nightly builds of Firefox. If you haven’t already installed Chrome, I highly recommend that you give it a try. It will enhance your web browsing experience! Be sure to check out our list of recommended extensions. Likewise, Firefox is also a great browser. However, full WebGL support is not provided in the latest recommended release. Fortunately, you can grab a Firefox nightly build to get access to all the latest and greatest features, including an updated version of WebGL. While you’re at it, be sure to check out some other cool Chrome experiments. If you have some time to kill, create something cool and drop the link to it in the comments! We can’t wait to see what you come up with. ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Browser","Google"],

        "title": "A Brief Introduction to Discrete Mathematics",
        "excerpt":"About Discrete Mathematics is probably the most fundamental mathematics in Computer Science. Skilled programmers and software designers should be fluent in this mathematics, possibly over Calculus, as the number of applications of subjects in the field of Discrete Mathematics exceed those of Calculus, with respect to Computer Science. This is a course I highly recommend students take before trying to bust through Calculus. What is Discrete Mathematics? Discrete Mathematics is the spectrum of mathematics that includes, most notably, logic, set theory, probability, graph theory, number theory, and combinatorics. Notice you don’t see Algebra, Calculus, or Geometry. Subjects that are more fundamental (i.e. Algebra) or concrete (i.e. Geometry) are found their most abstract forms when analyzed in Discrete Mathematics. For example, a trivial abstract geometry problem that has a simple answer goes as follows:           Chessboard     &#8220;A standard chessboard is tiled with black and white tiles. Two opposite corners of the chessboard are removed. Is it possible to cover up the board using 2 x 1 dominoes without overlap?&#8221;   This is a problem that combines beauty from geometry and logic (surprisingly, not advanced combinatorics).   Discrete Mathematics opens up an entirely new branch of thinking, with surprisingly interesting topics. Rather than rushing through Calculus or Statistics, taking a break to actually let the knowledge they&#8217;d unknowingly acquired sink in, and exploring a field of mathematics that has much more use in Computer Science.   Interesting (basic) Discrete Mathematics Problems   Find the number of solutions (x, y) to the Diophantine Equation 20x + 12y = 2012 (AIME 2012).            Prove that sqrt(2) is irrational.                  Let there be some square of side length 2. Prove that, if 5 points are placed either in the interior or on the perimeter, that 2 of them are less than ?2 units apart.

        "title": "5 Ways to Enjoy Your New Smartphone",
        "excerpt":" So you finally made the switch. The big upgrade. You’ve entered the new age of technology and embraced the wonder that is the smart phone. Well, I’m sure you’re quickly learning just how amazing they are. So amazing, in fact, that it’s hard to remember everything they can do. So, to that end, here’s a guide of five ways you can maximize the enjoyment of your new smartphone.   1) Travel Everyone travels, even if only to occasionally and only to the other side of the city. Having a device that can not only track your location but provide specific turn by turn directions to where you want to go is essential these days. It streamlines the process of both commuting and travel while ensuring the safety and timeliness of the commuter. For those who are avid travelers there’s even more benefits packed into your new smart phone. Here’s a list of some traveling uses for your brand new smart phone:   Staying connectedStaying connected as you travel is extremely important whether it be business, casual, or leisure. Between wi-fi and your built in cellular network, your smartphone allows you to stay up to date with email, mobile computing and online access.   Apps like FlightviewFlightview lets you check your flight times quickly and easily. It continually updates itself as well, so you’re sure to have the latest word on your flight. With this and other apps there’s much less worry involved in travel. No more rushing to the airport just to find your flight delayed.   Never get lost in a strange cityAll smartphones either come with built in GPS or can be turned into one using a store bought app. These are practically a must for any type of travel in a strange city.   Pack lessYour smartphone lets you travel lighter by cutting down on your gadgetry. No longer do you need a GPS system, phone, PDA, laptop, etc. Now you can pack them all around in one condensed version via your new smartphone.   2) Business Smartphones have long been geared for business use. They’ve literally replaced PDAs and in some cases even business laptops—at the very least able to sub in in a pinch and temporarily replace a laptop. With the computing power packed into the portable smartphone it’s possible to do a wide variety of business activities. They:   Organize your work week, meetings, and in general calendar  Have powerful and fluid email systems in place, allowing ease of access and use.  Offer a plethora of different sources for news. They have apps, the internet, newsfeeds and news-letters that beam in straight to your phone. Never miss another update.  Allow extreme communication. There’s instant messaging, texts, emails, notifications, and even the good old classic phone call.  Have apps that focus on a wide range of different businesses. These include data, spread sheets, graphs, research, market trends, etc. All these allow you to tackle your niche and stay efficient, even on the go.  3) Games Smartphones are a huge rising force in the video game industry. They’re the latest and greatest, and are perfect for casual video games. It’s exploded on the market and really opened up a whole new exciting use for smartphones. Some of the more popular games are:   Farmerama  Fruit Ninja  Angry Birds  Draw Something  Words with Friends  4) Staying Connected and Browsing the Web Maybe you’re not much of a traveler, not really into business, and gaming isn’t your thing. There’s still the added bonus of being connected and having internet access wherever you have service. This is a huge benefit, and I’ve regularly used this for awesome casual usage. For example, I commonly:   Browse popular sites such as Facebook, failblog, and reddit.  Check Wikipedia or use good ole Google to settle an argument.  Look for that obscure piece of information I’ve either forgotten or am curious about  Explore the internet while I have downtime. This staves off boredom and turns what would otherwise be a dull time into an awesome time.  5) Apps I’ve already mentioned apps in other categories, but it deserves its own! Apps maximize the fun you can have and supplement your new smartphone in just about every way. So, no matter what you’re into, make sure you’re utilizing apps. Because without them, you’re surely not fully enjoying your new smartphone.   Welcome to the new world, where boredom is a scarcity. There are thousands of ways to entertain yourself and generally make your life more awesome. Just whip out your new smartphone and be amazed at the power at your fingertips.

        "title": "The 2012 Google I/O Keynotes Bring Nexus 7 Tablet, Android Jelly Bean, Nexus Q, and More",
        "excerpt":"   Google held its annual I/O developer conference this week in San Francisco, bringing an onslaught of product updates and new devices. The event took place over the course of three days, and the three major keynotes have been recorded and uploaded to Google’s developer YouTube Channel. They’re all over an hour, so watching them is a major time investment. Fortunately, you can catch a glimpse of what went on from the highlights video that Google put together (above). The first keynote was the most significant one. Updates for the Nexus tablet and Android OS were announced, and Google Glass and the Nexus Q were unveiled.    The Nexus 7 tablet sets a new standard for Android tablets and the Kindle Fire alike. The updated Nexus boasts a thin, sleek black body that runs Android Jelly Bean. The device has 1 GB of RAM, a 1.3 GHz quad-core CPU, a NFC, a 12-core Tegra 3 processor, an da 1.2 megapixel front-facing camera. Even with this powerful hardware it manages to run for 8 hours on a single charge. It comes in both a $200 8 GB model and a $250 16GB model. The screen is 7-inches, with dimensions of 1280 by 800 pixels. This makes it a cross between a smartphone and other popular tablets like the iPad.    Every Android operating system release is given a silly name, and this one is no exception. Dubbed “Jelly Bean”, it introduces a bunch of new features to the OS. For one, the new interface is much faster than that of its predecessor. It runs at 60 frames per second, and it responds to touch better. Also, the home screen has been redesigned to allow for widget resizing an moving. In addition, voice typing can now be done offline. Similar to Microsoft’s live tiles, the notifications now include images, live updates, and more information. Individual notification messages can be closed with a gesture. To make searching easier, questions can be verbally asked in natural language and they will be answered to the best of the device’s ability. It reminds me of Siri, but the voice is a little bit smoother. If you take a lot of pictures, you will will be glad to hear that the camera app has been updated to allow for quick photo viewing and deleting. Another feature that should have been included included a long time ago is faster app updating. When you update an app, only parts of the app that have changed will be updated. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Google Now will be integrated. This allows for intelligent information suggestions based on your location. For example, when you go to a restaurant you might be offered menu recommendations. It has been public knowledge that the Project Glass team has been working on some high-tech glasses for a while now, but the specifics weren’t known. During the keynote, an awesome tech demo was given that consisted of skydivers and BMX bikers streaming a live camera feed from their Google Glasses to a Google Hangout. The focus was clearly on  the built-in camera that is always readily available for capturing photos and videos.    The prototype glasses sported a small transparent screen that was located above the field of view on the right lens. It is able to send texts, record images and video, and display maps without leaving your face. It makes use of buttons and voice-commands to control the device, which includes a microphone, speaker, gyroscope, and compass. The glasses can only connect to the internet over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, making their mobile usage slightly limited. A $1,500 beta version of glasses is for sale at the conference, and the final glasses are planned to be released in 2013 for a cheaper price.    A new device called the Nexus Q is essentially an Android device accessory that plays streaming internet content. Once plugged into speakers or a TV, the $299 black sphere can be controlled by a phone or tablet to play music or videos from any of Google’s media services (YouTube, Google Play, Music, and Google Play TV). A line of lights forms a band around the Nexus Q that react to music by flashing colors. When plugged into a TV, the sphere can provide a colorful music visualizer. As far as hardware goes, the 4.6 inch sphere has a built-in 25-watt amp, 1 GB of RAM, 12-core Tegra 3 processor, and 16 GB of flash memory. You can pre-order it now and expect it to be shipped in 2-3 weeks. Day two of the event was a little bit less exciting. Updates on the statistics and popularity of Google Chrome, Google Drive, Google ChromeBook, Google Compute Engine, and the HTML5/CSS3 platform were given. Google Chrome now has over 310 million active users that collectively type 60 billion words into Chrome every day. Google claims that it is the most popular browser, but studies have been done that show otherwise. Most importantly, Chrome is now available in the iOS App Store. It allows for tab synching, the omnibox, unlimited tabs, tab controlling gestures, and many other Chrome features that are available on the desktop version.    Google Drive was launched about 10 weeks ago, with the goal of making files available everywhere. Google is now one step closer to accomplishing their goal, as Google Drive is now available for both ChromeBooks and iOS devices. It not only lets you browse your files, but also search for words in documents and images. The most impressive feature is the option to search for images and their contents using image recognition technology. For instance, you could search for a strawberry and all pictures containing a strawberry would appear as results. On ChromeBooks, Google Drive is heavily integrated to the point where it essentially becomes the file system. All content is synched between devices. Additionally, Google Documents now allow for graceful offline editing. As soon as the ChromeBook is reconnected to the internet, the document changes are uploaded. Google Drive now has  a powerful SDK that enables third party applications to save documents to the drive and be the default web applications for certain file types on the drive ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets","Google","Hot News"],

        "title": "Chrome and Google Drive Hit the iOS App Store",
        "excerpt":" The much awaited Google Chrome and Google Drive apps appeared in the app store on Thursday, after they were announced at Google’s I/O developer conference. They provide a new means of browsing the web and transferring files on Apple’s iPhone, iPod, and iPad devices. Almost immediately after its release on the iOS platform, Chrome skyrocketed to the top of the charts. Google Drive followed suit, accompanying Chrome in the top 50 free apps list. The new Chrome app  lets you sync your bookmarks, tabs, passwords, and settings between all of your devices. The simplistic interface is made up of the control bar at the top of the screen, and the web page on the rest of the screen. The control bar consists of backwards and forwards buttons, the omnibar, an action button, and a tabs button. For those of you unfamiliar with the omnibar, it allows for the entering of both URLs and search queries. While you type into it, query suggestions appear under the bar. When tapped, the actions button allows for the favoriting the current page, the reloading of the current page, the creation of a new tab, the viewing of open tabs on other devices, the finding of text in a page, and more. The tabs button lets you view all of your currently open tabs in a vertically layered interface (pictured above).  The keyboard for typing in the omnibar is different than that of the default iOS keyboard. It displays frequently used keys, such as the comma, colon, hyphen, and backslash keys at the top of the keyboard, and the QWERTY keyboard at the bottom. Miscellaneous gestures that make browsing easier can be used in Chrome. One of the more useful and obvious ones is the swiping from one side of the screen to the other, which allows for quick switching between tabs. The downsides of using Chrome include the inability to set it as your default browser, and the noticeable slowness that is a result of Apple’s limitations on 3rd party browsers. The first can be overcome by using a Safari bookmark to open webpages in Chrome, or by Jailbreaking your device and installing a tweak called BrowserChooser. The latter has to be endured because Apple doesn’t provide app developers with access to its Nitro javascript rendering engine. Web pages take a little longer to load, and web page scrolling might be slightly unresponsive at times.    Google Drive was released just over 10 weeks ago with the purpose of letting you easily sync your files between your devices. Like existing competitors, it also lets you share your files with friends. The release of this service on iOS devices is great for people that have been Google Docs power users. The mobile browser interface for Google Docs is pretty bad, and it doesn’t allow for the uploading or downloading of files.  Although documents can’t be created or edited within the Google Drive app, they can be created or opened in third party applications, like Kindle or Dropbox, and edited there. The changes or new documents will then be synced to your Google Drive account. If you want to have access to your documents when you don’t have an internet connection, you  can enable offline access for specific documents from the document option menu. From the same menu, documents can be shared with your contacts. You can download Google Chrome for free from it’s app store page HERE, and Google Drive for free from the app store page HERE.

        "title": "Apple Releases New Podcast App for iOS",
        "excerpt":"     iTunes is a bloated and overly sophisticated piece of software on both PCs and iOS. Until now, it was the center of all media subscriptions and purchases on iOS. Apple understands that iTunes needs improvement, and they want to make media more readily available. Because of this, they have decided to take the first step towards slimming down iTunes by releasing a standalone Podcasts app. It provides all of the features found in iTunes and more.   The app, which has been available since Tuesday, is extremely similar to its section in the iTunes app. The major difference is the added functionality of subscribing to podcasts. Once you have navigated to a podcast&#8217;s page in the app, you have the options of streaming particular episodes or downloading them for future listening/viewing. Plus, there is a subscribe button that will add the podcast to the podcasts section of your library. Once you have subscribed to a podcast, you can easily access it via the podcasts page, and you can choose to have it update automatically with new content. Additionally, you can have new episodes downloaded to your device automatically. Episodes that have been listened to are marked accordingly, so you don&#8217;t have to remember.      There are several ways of finding and viewing new podcasts. The first way is in the catalog page. It presents podcasts using the old iTunes interface, and it breaks them into &#8220;Featured&#8221; and &#8220;Top Charts&#8221; sections. If you have a podcast in mind, you can perform a text search for it too. The other way to find and view podcasts is on the &#8220;Top Stations&#8221; section of the library page. It sports a beautiful visual presentation of the podcast categories and subcategories, along with the popular podcasts that are in each of these subcategories.   In my opinion, the podcast player is superior to that of the default music app. All of the necessary controls, such as the volume slider and play/pause buttons, are present, and they have a unique grey metal design.  Additional controls include buttons for rewinding, fast-forwarding, and jumping either 10 seconds back or 30 seconds forward. These audio navigating controls are extremely useful when listening to long segments of audio content. Sliding the podcast art up reveals a sleep timer, a share button, and a togglable slow/normal/fast switch.   As of now, the podcasts section in the iTunes app still exists, but it is likely that Apple will discontinue it in a later operating system release.   Unfortunately, the app is only available on devices running iOS 5.1.1 or later, so users of older devices will be left out. You can download Podcasts from the app store here.

        "title": "Google to Shut Down iGoogle, Google Video, and More",
        "excerpt":"   Google recently announced in a blog post that they would be doing some “spring cleaning” by shutting down numerous services of waning popularity. Due to the huge number of services that Google creates and operates every year, it is completely understandable that they are forced to shut down services that aren’t showing promise or have been effectively replaced. It’s all part of a sustainable business model. The services that are going to be closed within the next year include iGoogle, Google Video, Google Mini, Google Talk Chatback, and the Symbian Search app. While most people have never heard of any these services, there is a large following behind iGoogle an Google Video. For many years, thousands of people have used iGoogle as a homepage for their browser. It served as an information central, presenting news, comics, inboxes and more all on the same page. I recall using it for the better part of a year, and it provided me with an excellent place to jot down notes and get Gmail updates. It is unfortunate that it will be coming to an end by October of 2013. Google claims that the common usage and popularity of smart phones, which allow for quick and easy access to all kinds of information, has made comprehensive browser start pages obsolete, saying the following:   We originally launched iGoogle in 2005 before anyone could fully imagine the ways that today’s web and mobile apps would put personalized, real-time information at your fingertips. With modern apps that run on platforms like Chrome and Android, the need for iGoogle has eroded over time, so we’ll be winding it down. Google Video is also a somewhat popular service that will be shut down, albeit for a good reason. Back in 2006, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. This huge investment paid off as YouTube rapidly became the most popular video sharing hub on the internet. It effectively made Google Video obsolete. Due to the adoption of YouTube, uploads to Google Video have been disabled since 2009. There are still many great old videos that can be found on the website. Fortunately, those videos will be migrated over to YouTube as private videos on August 20th. ","categories": ["Google","Hot News"],

        "title": "How to Set a Static IP Address on Windows",
        "excerpt":"   Every computer has an unique Internet Protocol Address. An Internet Protocol address is a largely numeric identification code used to represent computers on the internet. Internet Protocol or IP uses up to twelve characters that are usually numbers, with the exception of IP six which uses an alpha numeric representation. Static Internet Protocol is often compared with dynamic Internet Protocol. This is due in large part to the fact that Static Internet Protocol addresses are configured to each computer and are therefore unchanging, while Dynamic Internet Protocol addresses are changed every time the computer is rebooted. This happens as a result of most routers assigning an Internet Protocol address to the Computer dynamically. As with all things, there are pros and cons when setting up a Static Internet Protocol address, but once you have decided to go this route, you will find that the setup process is not a very difficult one. INSTRUCTIONS   First, turn on your computer and wait for it to boot. After the computer has been successfully booted, go to your start menu at the bottom left hand corner of your screen. Some computers will simply have an icon to represent this feature.  After clicking start, look to the right of the pop-up menu and select the Run option from the same. At this point a prompt window will pop up with a drop down menu asking users to make a decision. Type “cmd” in the open box and select ok. This option will take you to a Command Prompt window.  After the Command Prompt window has been opened, type “ipconfig /all” in it. After ensuring that this command is correctly entered, press the enter key. At this point a lot of information will be displayed.  From all the information listed on the screen, users should use the scratch pad to make note of the following as it will be needed later on:  IP Address, Subnet Mask, Default Gateway and Name Servers.          After recording the information, type the word “exit” into the same window and press the enter key to close it.      Go back to the Start menu at the bottom left hand corner of the screen and once again look to the right of the pop-up menu. Select the Control Panel option from the menu.      In Control Panel, select “Network Connections” or “Network and Internet” depending on the version of Windows you are using using. When the Network window is opened, right click the internet connection that you use to connect to the internet and select “properties”.      From the Properties menu, select Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and then click the properties button. A window will pop-up and you should record the information on this page before making any changes. This will help to ensure that any changes made can be undone if necessary.      To make changes, first pick an IP address (one can use the IP address for the router and simply change the last number). The last number of the chosen IP address should be between 1 and 254.      Enter the information that was previously recorded on the scratch pad. That is, place the Subnet Mask information in the Subnet Mask section and do the same for Default Gateway and Name Servers.        TIPS AND WARNINGS   If, after making your IP address static, you cannot load any web pages, there was possibly an error in the DNS that was entered. In this case, you should contact your service provider in order to figure out the correct DNS information.  A Static IP address is most useful when you are port forwarding as the forwarding address needs to be a fixed one. If the IP address were dynamic, you would not be able to receive a signal and load web pages because port forwarding cannot take place.  Joy is a technical guy and also content builder for many sites and he likes to write on technical topics and issues. Nowadays he writes on simple topic like how to change IP address, How to hide IP, how to set static IP etc. and share it for peoples ","categories": ["How To","Windows"],

        "excerpt":"   Most users of Apple’s iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads are restricted to using only certain apps that Apple approves of. This is often referred to as Apple’s “walled garden” since you are protected from rogue apps and you aren’t able to try anything outside of what Apple allows. Ever since a few days after the initial release of iOS, however, developers have been finding ways to exploit iOS run custom software. This practice has adopted the name “Jailbreaking”, as it lets you “break out of Apple’s jail”. In this guide I will walk you through Jailbreaking your iOS 5.1.1 devices (you can check what version your device is running by going to settings-&gt; general-&gt; about). This effectively installs an app called “Cydia” (a Jailbreak app store) and it gives you root access to the file system of your device. Once your device is Jailbroken, you will be able to install great apps that Apple has rejected from the app store and apply tweaks and themes that make your iOS experience more enjoyable and unique. Also, since Absinthe provides an untethered jailbreak, you will be able to restart your device without being connected to a computer. Step One: Attach Your Device to Your Computer  Connect your iPhone, iPod Touch to your computer using a dock connecter to USB cable. iTunes will probably open automatically, and that’s good. If it doesn’t, open iTunes manually. Step Two: Back Up Your Data    Back up your device by right clicking its icon in the iTunes sidebar and selecting “Back Up”. This will let you restore your device easily in case you want to reverse your jailbreak, you want to update iOS, or the jailbreaking process fails. After your backup is complete, quit iTunes. Step Three: Download Absinthe Chronic-Dev team’s Absinthe is the application for your PC that will perform the actual jailbreaking process. Download it for Mac, Windows, or Linux here. Step Four: Run Absinthe and Wait  Once your download is complete, extract the Absinthe application and run it. Click the “Jailbreak” button that appears and wait. As will be described via onscreen instructions, your device will go through a fake restore session and then it will reboot. Wait until the Absinthe window tells you that the jailbreak is complete before disconnecting and using the device. If, for some reason, you have waited for a while and the last process never quite finishes, it is probably safe to unplug your device and use it. Congratulations, your device is now jailbroken! Check out the Cydia app and start installing packages! ","categories": ["How To","iOS"],

        "title": "An Introduction to the Wonderful World of Infrared Photography",
        "excerpt":"Taking pictures at night used to be impossible without having some sort of light source. These days, technology has changed all that. With the use of infrared, or IR, cameras can capture images even in scenes with little or no light. Best of all, IR is not visible to the human eye, so you can take photos at night without anyone knowing, or without disturbing wildlife for example. Using this technology during the day can also create some stunning photographic effects. Read on to find out how this technology works and what you need to start taking infrared photos. An understanding of infrared light is helpful here. Infrared light occupies the wavelengths from about 700 nanometers to 1 millimeter. These longer wavelengths of light are not visible to the naked human eye, and lie beside red visible light on the spectrum. The infrared light referred to in IR photography covers 700 nanometers to 900 nanometers and is within the near infrared spectrum. The rest of the infrared spectrum involves mid infrared and far infrared, which is used in thermal imaging.  While IR light allows a camera to capture images in the dark, standard cameras use an IR filter to prevent this light from entering the camera. Removing or adjusting this filter will cause daytime photos to appear overly white, but not washed out as in the photo below. This is accomplished by allowing IR light to pass through to the camera while blocking most of the visible light spectrum. When used on foliage, the reflection of light off of the leaves gives a white, almost snow-like effect. The effect is known as the Wood Effect after the infrared photography pioneer Robert W. Wood. Infrared photography also tends to make the sky very dark, as seen in the photo below. Other effects of infrared photography include the ability to penetrate some clothing, veins being visible under skin, eyes becoming black, and skin appearing pale.           Photo Credit: Justin Bell   The use of IR light in nighttime or dark scenes gives the effect of being able to see in the dark. Infrared light will “light up” a scene without the scene becoming more visible to the naked eye. This technology is used in surveillance cameras and trail cameras for photographing wildlife. It is possible to take night vision photographs with a standard camera by simply holding a night vision device in front of the lens. Night vision devices come in several configurations including binoculars, monocular, goggles, and scopes. These devices work by either amplifying ambient IR light or by projecting IR light onto the scene to light it up. The illuminated image is then sent to the viewing lens or onto a display. The photo below shows a night vision monocular.  This setup is a good way to take infrared photos if your camera does not have the ability to adjust the IR filter. However, it is not necessarily cost effective unless you already own a night vision device or have other uses for one, as these devices cost hundreds of dollars. If you decide to go the camera/night vision device route, you will need a way to hold the night vision device steady in front of your camera. You can use a camera slidebar, which can be found in camera stores or online, or you can build your own setup using wood or other materials. So whether you opt to adjust the camera you already have or go with a night vision and camera setup, you can easily start taking IR photos and night vision photos. Once you get the basic method of IR photos down, you can start using more advanced techniques which can be found with a Google search.     Craig Pearson is an avid hunter, outdoorsman, and adventurist. His main passions are hog hunting in Texas and writing about his many adventures. He currently blogs for nightvision 4 less, a supplier of high quality night vision equipment.

        "title": "Top 15 Jailbreak Apps and Tweaks",
        "excerpt":"Jailbreaking your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad enables you to install thousands of apps and tweaks from Cydia. If you’re reading this, you’re probably considering jailbreaking your device, or you have recently jailbroken it and you’re wondering what useful and fun software you can now install. If either of these is the case, then you’ve come to the right place! In this post I will present to you what I have found to be the greatest tweaks and apps from Cydia, along with their corresponding repositories and prices. If this is your first time downloading and installing packages in Cydia, it may seem rather confusing. Allow me to explain: Cydia is merely a means of searching for and installing software from software repositories of your choice. The only tabs you really need to know about and use are the Manage and Search tabs. You start off connected to several major sources that host the most famous and useful tweaks and apps, but you may wish to add sources in order to install specific packages. To do this, hit the Sources button in the Manage tab, tap “Edit”, and press the Add button. Once you have added a source you can search through its packages in either the Sections tab or the Search tab. Using the latter is much more efficient and helpful. 1. SBSettings SBSettings has been around since the beginning of jailbreaking. This famous package lets you create a gesture  or button combination (using Activator) that will cause a slide-down settings window to appear. It allows for very fast and convenient access to frequently changed settings.There are also come powerful controls in the bar under the settings options. For instance, you may want to respring your device every so often after applying or disabling a tweak on your device. In addition, you can see important statistics, such as available storage, a the bottom of the window. For even further functionality, 3rd party widgets are available for the SBSettings window. The default theme is rather ugly. I recommend choosing the “Serious SBSettings HD” theme in the SBSettings options window. SBSettings works across all versions and models of iOS devices, and it can be found in the default BigBoss repository for free.    2. iFile iFile is essentially Finder for iOS. It is a full blown file manager that lets you navigate through all of the directories and files on your device. It boasts advanced file reading and writing functionality, along with the support of  archiving, unarchiving, copying, and pasting of files and folders. Additionally, you can bookmark folders, attach files to emails, send music to the iPod app, and host a web server for accessing your files. iFile is free with the option to pay for more advanced features (that you probably don’t need). It can be found on the BigBoss repository with a simple search.    3. Winterboard One of the main reasons people jailbreak their devices is to be able to apply themes. Winterboard is the  most popular method to do just that. When you first install it, it doesn’t appear to be able to do much. You can choose between a few minor adjustments within the Winterboard app itself, but that’s pretty much it. However, after you install a Winterboard theme from Cydia, it will appear in the Winterboard app and you will be able to apply it. Themes can change the way certain aspects of iOS look, as well as add functionality to them. For instance, you can have a video wallpaper, some custom sounds, a custom lock screen, and a custom font. Themes can also swap out the icons of certain apps. Grab Winterboard for free from the Cydia/Telesphoreo repository (that should be added by default).    4. IntelliScreenX IntelliScreenX takes the Notification Center information and puts it right on the lock screen, so you don’t have to unlock your device to check on updates, weather, and more. It also supports widgets, such as a basic RSS notifier. Perhaps the handiest feature, however, is the line of useful controls at the top of the lock screen. With them, you can quickly toggle settings such as WiFi and Bluetooth. Not only can you view your notifications, but you can also send tweets, emails, and messages right from your lock screen. IntelliScreenX can be found on the ModMyi repository for $9.99 (there’s a free trial).  5. FolderEnhancer Folders were a welcomed feature when they were first introduced in iOS 4. However, they are very limited, and they certainly leave much to be desired. FolderEnhancer fixes this by adding support for unlimited apps per folder (sorted in pages), folders inside of folders, and toggleable folder animations. FolderEnhancer can be found in the BigBoss repository for $2.49.    6. biteSMS If you have an iPhone and you use the Messages app frequently, you will love biteSMS. It is a complete messaging app the builds upon the default mesagins app by adding features such as Quick Compose, Quick Reply, Passcode Lock, Privacy, Contact Pictures, Smileys, Signatures, Templates, Auto-Retry, and much more. Plus, if you aren’t on an unlimited texting plan, you can save a lot of money by switching to biteSMS’s texting plan, in which you buy credits that allow you to send text messages for 12 cents. biteSMS can be downloaded for free from the http://cydia.bitesms.com repository.    7. Activator Touch gestures are essential for touch screen devices, and iPhones, iPod Touches, and iPads are no exception. They make navigating through various interfaces fast and fun. Activator takes touch gestures and button combinations to a whole new level. With one of dozens of gestures, you can easily launch an app or perform a system action. In addition to finger gestures, you can choose button combinations as activation methods. For example, I have Activator set up to open Grooveshark when I press both volume buttons, and reveal the SBSettings window when I press and hold the status bar. Activator can be found in the BigBoss repository for free, but it is automatically installed with many other apps, like SBSettings. 8. InfiniDock This tweak lets you add an unlimited number of icons to your dock. It organizes these icons into pages, and it lets you choose how many icons you want on each of these dock pages. InfiniDock can be found in the BigBoss repository for $1.99.  9. MyWi MyWi gives you the ability to turn your iPhone into a WiFi hotspot without an expensive plan with your carrier. Once it is installed and activated,you can share your 3G connection with other devices by either creating a WiFi hotspot or attaching said devices to your phone via an USB cable. There are also some advanced features like data usage, signal strength, and number of active users. Be careful not to abuse your connection though, lest you face the wrath of your carrier. Surprisingly, it doesn’t drain your battery all that quickly; your iPhone can last for up to a day while running MyWi. MiWi sells for an expensive $19.99 on the ModMyi repository. Fortunately, there is a free trial, so make sure it works for you before you buy it. Also, consider how much money you save by buying this app instead of paying for an expensive data plan.  10. Quasar   This fantastic tweak is only for the iPad. It brings true multi-tasking to iOS by allowing you to open apps in separate windows. All of the open windows appear on the same toggleable screen, and they can be used simultaneously. Each window has orientation and resizing controls, as well as a close button. Thanks to the default iOS multitasking, closing an app’s window is more like minimizing it. Apps can easily be reopened from the multi-tasking bar. For what it does, it’s a bargain. You can grab a copy from the BigBoss repository for $9.99.    11. Dashboard X Dashboard X brings widgets to the home screen of your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad. Widgets made for Notification center, such as the default weather widget, can be placed anywhere on your device screen. If you do some searching, you will find that there are hundreds of such widgets floating around Cydia, bringing anything from Nyan Cat to SBSettings right to your home screen. Dashboard X is available from the ModMyi repository for $1.99.    12. Barrel The swipe through animation for switching between home screen pages is nice, but Barrel takes it to a whole new level. Once installed, it will provide you with a large list of home screen page swiping animations. The most famous animations make it look like your icons are on walls of a cube (you can choose whether or not they are inside or outside of the cube too). Barrel is available for a steep $2.99 in the BigBoss repository.      13. Zephyr With Zephyr you can change the way you switch between applications and show the multitasking bar. To switch applications, simply sliding your finger left or right on the screen. Similarly, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to reveal the multitasking bar. Many new gestures are planned for the future. For what it does, it’s a little bit expensive. You can download it from the BigBoss repository for $2.99.    14. Spire The Spire Cydia tweak makes it easy to install Siri on unsupported devices (iPod Touches, iPads, old iPhones). It’s very stable, and it operates legally. All Siri files are downloaded from Apple’s servers, and you have to specify a Siri proxy server to use for voice command processing. It is worth noting that you need an iPhone 4s key (NOT an iPhone 4s) in order to connect to most servers (you can probably grab one from a friend or a Google search). Spire can be found in the BigBoss repository  for the fabulous price of free.  15. BrowserChooser Popularized after the release of Chrome for iOS, BrowserChooser, lets you choose a third party browser application and make it the default. Any “Open in Safari” buttons, icon bookmarks, and links will open in the browser of your choice. BrowserChooser is free from the http://rpetri.ch/repo repository.

        "title": "New Android App Filters Out Negative Messages When You&#8217;re Stressed",
        "excerpt":"  We’ve all had one of those days where we really can’t be bothered dealing with mardy, spiteful, or generally negative messages. These days require full concentration and do not need someone dumping their emotional baggage on your doorstep. Quite often, such days are derailed by a negative text message; something mean spirited, fun-sapping or just plain nasty. On days like these, a handy service that warns you about negative and horrible messages would be an absolute lifesaver, or would at least help you to delay the buzz kill long enough to get something done. Well, that handy service is now available in the form of a free smartphone app for phones running Google’s Android OS. Developed by a Master’s student at the University of Portsmouth, the application is as smart as you would want, and your information is gathered from social media websites to predict the content of the incoming message. Mohamed Gaber, a senior lecturer at the University, explained how the application could assist many in their day to day lives. He outlined how, through analyzing the recent social media activity of the sender, the smart application could make intelligent predictions about whether or not the message would be positive, negative or neutral. This information is then transferred into a simple and user friendly color coding system, with green representing ‘positive’, red representing ‘negative’ and blue representing a neutral message. The application also analyses the language used in the message and other factors which help it to decide on the level of stress it may cause you. If you feel that you are in a good frame of mind and ready to deal with anything that might be thrown your way; a red message need not be something to fear. If you’re in right in the middle of something that requires concentration, a red message might be best left until later, when you have more energy to devote to it. On the flipside of this, a green message can supply you with the impetus and momentum to move forward on a particularly tough day. For Mr. Gaber, it’s all about managing your life and the information you receive. “The ultimate objective of this application is to make the user aware of the negative content they receive so they are able to manage their stress in the best possible way,” he explained. The application, “Stress @ Work”, was developed by Lorraine Chambers, who believes it could be potentially very useful, particularly for people with busy lives who feel that constant connectivity is not all it’s cracked up to be. Anything that gives us some degree of control over the input that floods into our lives on a daily basis can’t be bad. As of yet, no test versions of the application have been released, so its efficacy is difficult to gauge. However, if it works as well as its developer and her lecturer predict, we could be seeing this smart little application appearing on thousands of Android smartphones in the very near future.

        "title": "Valve is Developing a Steam Client for Linux",
        "excerpt":" Valve, the massive video game company behind the social game distribution software Steam, recently announced that a Steam client for Ubuntu Linux is in the making. The announcement, made via a new company blog dedicated to Linux, described how Valve managing director Gabe Newell has been looking forward to bringing their gaming network and Source game engine to Linux for some time. They’ve already been supporting the Linux platform with their server software, but Valve is finally ready to take the next step. The Valve Linux team has chosen Ubuntu as the initial distribution to release their software on because it is the most popular distribution and games have had success on the platform in the past. However, Valve says that they hope to bring Steam to other distributions in the future as well. The Steam client is great for socializing with fellow gamers, but that’s not it’s main feature. It is popular for providing an easy way to find, buy, and install games. This, of course, means that in order to make Steam for Linux viable, popular games have to be ported or created for the Linux platform. Valve says that they have plans to first port the incredible Left 4 Dead 2 to Ubuntu, and then go from there. As of now, Linux is by no means considered a gaming platform. Sure, there are a couple of great games out there, but not nearly enough to lure gamers. We look forward to seeing how Steam will change the way Linux is used and thought of.

        "title": "New YouTube Editing Feature Lets You Blur Faces in Videos",
        "excerpt":"   YouTube has updated their online video editing software to allow users to automatically blur out the faces of people in their videos. The idea behind this feature is to provide privacy and anonymity to activists, minors, and those not wishing to disclose their identity in publicly available videos. This blurring capability was first announced in an article on the official YouTube blog, in which Amanda Conway, a YouTube policy associate, described how “citizens continue to play a critical role in supplying news and human rights footage from around the world.” Being the most popular video sharing platform on the internet, it is important for YouTube to provide tools supporting the efforts of such people. As is to be expected, the blurring accuracy isn’t exactly great. It only works for very visible and direct face recordings. If the subjects of a video are somewhat far away or are not facing the camera, YouTube’s facial recognition fails, and their faces are not blurred. Thankfully, most quality video editors sport some sort of censoring or blurring tool, so if YouTube’s blurring feature isn’t adequate, you can always apply it by hand. One of the concerns voiced by people is that governments might be able to force YouTube to hand over the unedited versions of certain videos. If, for example, there is a group of extreme activists that commit a crime, and a censored video is posted of said activists, the government may be able to find out the identities of the activists and fine or jail them. However, it is important to remember that this is merely the first release of an exorbitantly complicated technology. It should be treated as such, and any videos of importance should be edited manually. It is also important to keep in mind that faces aren’t the only way to identify an individual. License plates, background scenery, and voices also provide significant clues. For now, this feature is best used to provide simple privacy to children in family videos or private speakers from anonymous conferences. On a related note, Google already blurs faces and license plates on Google Maps and Google Earth using automated software. I would not be surprised if license plate blurring functionality were added to the YouTube video editor in the foreseeable future. If you have a YouTube account and you are interested in utilizing this tool, you’ll be glad to hear that it’s a quick and easy process. Simply navigate to your Video Manager, select the video that you would like to edit, click the edit button for that video, and click the enhancements tab. Clicking on the Additional features button on that page, pictured above, will reveal the option to blur the faces of people in the video. Be sure to watch the preview to see if it did a satisfactory job. YouTube believes that the feature “allows people to share personal footage more widely and to speak out when they otherwise may not.” Hopefully this new technology will encourage users to post more entertaining, newsworthy, and controversial videos.

        "excerpt":" The next major release of the Mac operating system, OS X Mountain Lion, made it’s debut this morning in the Mac App Store after many months of development and public testing among the developer community. You can grab a copy of Mountain Lion exclusively from the Mac App Store for the fair price of $19.99. The download is large, so expect it to take an hour or more, and make sure that you have a strong and stable internet connection. It’s a shame that Apple no longer sells hard copies that can speed up the installation process, let you perform a clean install, and be used as emergency boot drives. If you have purchased a new Mac computer after June 11, you are eligible to receive a free redemption code that will let you install Mountain Lion from the Up-to-Date program on your computer. In what is a benevolent move on Apple’s part, copies of Mountain Lion can be installed on more than one computer. To do so, simply log into the other computer’s Mac App Store with your credentials and click the “Purchases” tab. From there, you can re-download the operating system with the click of a button. Mountain Lion boasts over 200 new features, the most significant of which being Notification Center, iMessage, Game Center, Dictation, Power Nap updating, iCloud integration for Notes and Reminders, social network sharing tools, and GateKeeper security. In summary, it brings the most popular features of iOS to Mac OS.    ","categories": ["Hot News","Mac"],

        "title": "Turntable.fm Takes Social Music Sharing to the Next Level, Lets You Be the DJ",
        "excerpt":"   Founded in early 2011, Turntable.fm provides a unique social music experience. Instead of posting a non-interactive tweet, Facebook post, or email about favorite songs and playlists, users of Turntable can hang out in a virtual club. Each “club” is complete with DJs, chat, and an audience. Thousands of rooms exist, each with users of different musical tastes. Anyone can step up to the to DJ table and play one of millions of songs in Turntable’s library, or a song that they have uploaded, making it a great way for new artists to introduce themselves and share their tracks. When a DJ is playing a song, members of the audience can vote on it by clicking the “Lame” or “Awesome” buttons at the bottom of the screen. If enough people click “Lame”, the song will be skipped. Clicking “Awesome” gives the DJ points, which can be used to unlock new avatars. Plus, it makes your head start bobbing to the music, which is surprisingly satisfying. Since rooms often contain people with similar tastes, listening in on one can be a great way to discover new music. One might argue that it is even better than music recommendation services like Pandora because every song is hand picked, and they might be from new or underground artists. Anybody can create a new room with the click of a button, and they will be given the option of choosing a room description, a room name, and a privacy level (public or private). Creating private rooms is a fun way to organize music for a party, a gaming clan, or even a workplace. Although the HTML5 and Javascript powered browser interface is great, you may find yourself wanting to listen to your favorite rooms on the go. Fortunately, there are official iOS and Android apps available that provide almost all of the functionality as their browser counterpart. They sport extremely intuitive and elegant interfaces that make using them fun and easy. ","categories": ["App Review","Awesome Websites","Music"],

        "title": "Google Announces Google Fiber: $70 1 Gbps Internet, Free 5 Mbps Internet",
        "excerpt":"   After months of dormancy, Google Fiber was officially launched today in Kansas City. It boasts blazing fast internet speeds of 1,000 Megabits per second (both upload and download). That’s roughly 100 times as fast as the average U.S. broadband connection! In addition to the Gigabit service, Google plans to offer free 5 Megabit per second internet to anyone willing to pay a $300 construction fee. In addition, they announced Fiber TV, a television network that will use the new fiber cables. During the 100 minute presentation, Google described how storage capacity and computer processing power have been increasing exponentially over the past couple of years, while internet speeds are increasing at a very slow and steady rate. The technology for a faster internet has been evolving quickly, but the U.S has failed to adopt such technology and has an overall slower internet speed than other countries. Google says that their goal and inspiration for the project is to have network speeds that increase exponentially with other technology in the near future. The fiber cables take a lot of time and money to install, so Google wants to start rolling them out where demand is high. They have selected  Kansas City as the initial installation area. However, most residents there will not have access to the service for quite some time, as Google is prioritizing neighborhoods based on how many households apply with a $10 pre-registration fee by September. In what is an excellent public relations move, Google will offer free 1 Gigabit connectivity to all schools, libraries, and hospitals in “fiberhoods”. Not only is this great for cities, but it also provides an initiative for people to sign up. Once the fiber cables are eventually installed in your neighborhood, you will have the option to subscribe to one of three packages. All packages require that you pay an initial $300 to get the fiber installed at your house. The first option will provide you with a free 5Mbps down and 1Mbps up internet connection for at least seven years. This crushes the competition, as they offer slightly faster speeds at a much more expensive price. The second plan offers the amazing 1 Gigabit download and upload internet connection for a reasonable $70 a month. The package also comes with 1 TB of Google Drive cloud storage, a $50 service on its own. The third package is a whopping $120 per month, and it consists of both a 1 Gigabit connection and Fiber TV. Like the basic 1 Gigabit plan, it too will provide you with 1 TB of Google Drive cloud storage. The Fiber TV service sports several major broadcast networks (notably excluding CNN, ESPN, and AMC), along with hundreds of fiber channels. Internet content from YouTube and Netflix can be viewed as well. For an additional cost, you can get on-demand movies and shows. Also, premium movie channels will be provided for an additional monthly fee. Subscribers of the Fiber TV plan will receive a complimentary Nexus 7 (which has a Google Fiber app), a 2 TB DVR service, and a Wi-Fi access point for TVs. ","categories": ["Google","Hot News"],

There are probably a few classic videos that you would love to share with friends or co-workers, or simply save to your computer hard drive for personal keeping. YouTube has been designed to allow users to watch videos on their website rather than download them. The good news is that there are a few tricks to save a YouTube video to your computer free of charge! The advantages of downloading videos are that you can watch them without the need to visit YouTube (or another video streaming service) and load the video over again. If you’re on a wireless internet plan, or have an internet package with a limited amount of bandwidth, then saving videos would also help to keep your bandwidth usage low. Saving a Video File In the past it was necessary to use an application in order to download a YouTube video. Today, we can simply make use of one of the many free online video downloaders. Such a website will allow you to enter the URL of the video in order to save it to your hard drive. These services are usually also compatible with other sites such as MetaCafe, DailyMotion, Vimeo, Veoh and more. Simply download a video via one of the following free services:   KeepVid: The free version of KeepVid allows you to download full length videos from all major video sharing websites. An added benefit is the ability to download a video in a number of formats.  SaveMedia: Simply paste in the URL to a video from your favourite video sharing website in order to display a list of download links. Another trick is to just replace “YouTube” with “SaveMedia” in the video URL, for example: http://SaveMedia.com/watch?v=xYZ2XyzYCOMWatching FLV Files Many online video downloaders will save the video as a .FLV file on your computer. This file format may not be compatible with the video playback software you have installed. You can use the following software to watch .FLV files:   VLC Player: VLC Player is open source software and compatible with multiple operating systems. The media player is compatible with almost any file format.  K-Lite Codec Pack: You can use the K-Lite Codec Pack to give your existing media players the ability to view .FLV and other file formats. This can also enhance the playback and performance of your videos and DVD’s.Convert YouTube Videos If you want to convert an .FLV to another file format such as .MPG or .AVI, then you can make use of one of the many free applications designed to do so. We recommend the following converters:   Media Converter: Use this tool to convert your video as well as audio files. You can also convert videos directly from YouTube and other sites such as Facebook.  Vixy: Vixy is a free application that allows you to download and convert videos and songs. Vixy FreeCorder is added to your browser as an extension for easy conversion.    Dean has 9 years of experience in the IT field, and enjoys writing articles about the latest in computer technology, including wireless broadband, internet services and 4G cards.

        "title": "Meetings.io Brings Fantastic Free Video Conferencing to Your Browser",
        "excerpt":" Video conferencing is nothing new; we’ve been doing it for years with software like Skype and ooVoo. However, using these services can be a little bit complicated, requiring that you first sign up, download a file, add contacts, and initiate a call with people that have also gone through the same process. Thanks to recent advancements in online software and internet technology, video conferences can be initiated from within modern browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, with the click of a button. No download required. Earlier this year, after receiving a million dollars of funding, a group of developers launched a new online service that promises to make setting up and conducting video conferences easy and productive. The service, Meetings.io, lets you create a virtual room where anybody can communicate with others through video, audio, chat,  and notes. The creator of a meeting room can make the room public (anyone with the link can join) or private (people have to be approved one by one). Plus, links to the room can be sent to recipients by SMS and email right from the meeting interface. If you create an account, you will be able to plan meetings and save meeting notes and chat logs. Also, you will have the option of making a personal room with a persistant vanity URL. Meetings.io distinguishes itself with its conferencing tools and ease of use. No registration or money is required to create a room, and anybody can join the room by clicking a link. In addition to basic video conferencing (currently limited to five people per room), several tools, including file sharing and screen sharing, are offered. There is also a shared notepad where participants can share links, videos, and notes. The underlying technology can be admired by anyone familiar with web development. The video aspect, unsurprisingly, relies on flash. However, both the tools and the video use peer-to-peer technology to send and receive data between video call participants. This not only requires fewer server resources, reducing the cost of business, but also makes data transfer faster and more responsive. Notable alternatives include Google+ Hangouts, in which users of Google’s social network can create a video chat room and allow friends to join, and AnyMeeting, which allows users to attend an ad-supported online video conference after signing up for an account. Both of these services lack additional sharing features, and both require that you go through a tedious sign-up process. Google Hangouts does sport Google Docs integration, though, making it greatly superior in terms of document collaboration and creation. ","categories": ["Awesome Websites"],

        "title": "Best Literary iPhone Apps",
        "excerpt":"   The iPhone has proven itself to be an incredibly handy device for a wide range of topics. It cures boredom in the most harrowing of waiting rooms, and can increase productivity when you’re on the go. You can also use your iPhone to catch up on news, magazines, books, and other forms of literary devices with a breadth of handy apps. Below are a few of my favorites. Multi-Media Flipboard First released for the iPad, Flipboard has successfully transferred its design and interface to the smaller screen of the iPhone by displaying two headlines at once but allowing users to flip quickly to the next page of headlines. As well, the iPhone version maintains intuitiveness by having a vertically flipping interface, rather than a left-to-right page turning style, allowing users to simply flip pages with their thumbs. The iPhone version is also incredibly fast, despite some server issues upon first release.  By employing your user accounts, Flipboard syncs to your other iDevices which allows you to have instant access to all of your magazine and newspaper subscriptions. eBooks Kindle Yes, the popular e-reader from Amazon is available on the iPhone as well. There are other e-readers from competitors, and while some look nicer or more polished none can match the content that Amazon provides.  If you have a Kindle as well, the iPhone app will sync up with the books you are reading so you are always in the same spot. This grants you the ability to leave your Kindle at home, but not your favorite books. You don’t have to be a kindle owner though. The free app still lets you create an account and you can purchase and read books solely on the iPhone. News BBC News I’ve used a number of news apps to stay caught up while I’m on the go, and so far BBC News has been my go to for world news. The BBC app offers not only top news stories, but a self-updating latest news tagline, a multitude of categories, a live radio feed, and videos to name a few. This app also offers the most customization so that your favorite categories show up on the first page, the font can be made larger or smaller, and you can share articles of interest with Facebook, Twitter, or email contacts. The app is free, but there are some advertisements as is common with free apps. Audiobooks Audible After downloading my audiobooks straight from the iTunes store and constantly hearing “this audio book is brought to you by Audible…” I decided to check out this handy app. Just like with the iTunes store, you can browse, purchase, and download audiobooks on your iPhone but in a much more streamlined design. The app will play in the background just like iTunes but it is tailor-made for audio books and offers features that the iPod player does not.  These include a news tab that show relevant new releases, a tool that keeps track of your listening statistics, bookmarking/note taking for specific parts of the audiobook, and shareable content to Facebook and Twitter. There are many apps out there to choose from, and your favorite magazine or newspaper probably has an app tailor made for it. These are generally free if you already have a subscription, but will probably have advertisements.     Carla Eaton has a B.A. in Mass Media and writes on the topics of business, technology, and design.

        "title": "Recommendation Service Foundd Helps You And Your Friends Find Good Movies, More Coming Soon",
        "excerpt":"    Personalized recommendation engines have existed since the earliest online services started popping up, and they have grown increasingly popular and accurate. They’re great for consumers that want to find new products or content to enjoy, and they increase sales for content producers. Most of these services have at least one of two problems: they’re not very accurate, and they’re a solitary experience. Recently launched movie recommendation service Foundd not only does a great job of recommending movies to you, but also to a group of your friends or family. When you first sign up (free), you’ll be prompted to rate some movies that you enjoyed. That way, Foundd has a basis on which to recommend movies. You can continue to rate movies for as long as you like; the more you rate the more likely Foundd is to find movies that you will like. After you have rated some movies, you can scan your “watchlist” of recommended movies for something that you think will interest you. So far, I’ve had a great experience with movies recommended for me. Their algorithm really works. What makes Foundd unique is the ability to invite friends and form groups with them. These groups, currently limited to five people, combine the movie ratings of everyone in them in order to generate a communal watchlist. As a result, movie nights with friends and family are more likely to sport a movie that everyone can enjoy. Plus, it saves time: there’s no longer a need to argue about which movies to watch. The developers behind Foundd hope to add support for book, app, game, video, and TV show recommendations in the foreseeable future. App recommendations have already proven to be popular and profitable by several companies, and video recommendations are sure to be fun and addicting if implemented properly.

        "title": "PHP Tutorial 5 &#8211; if/else Conditional Statements and Comparison Operators",
        "excerpt":" In programming, conditional statements are used to evaluate and compare sets of data. The “if” statement executes a block of code only if a certain condition is true. A comparison to this statement used in everyday life might be “If it is cloudy, then bring an umbrella” (cloudy being the condition, bringing an umbrella being the action or code). It is often used in conjunction with an “else” statement, which executes a block of code if the condition expressed in the if statement is not true. &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conditional Statements&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt; ?php$number = 5;if ($number == 5) {\techo \"The number is 5\";}?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;The above code will output “The value is 5”. This is because the condition in line 11 is true; the value of the variable $number is equal to 5. The “==” is the comparison operator in this case, and translates to “is equal to”. &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conditional Statements&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt; ?php$number = 2;if ($number == 5) {\techo \"The number is 5\";} else {\techo \"The number is not 5\";}?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;The above code will output “The number is not 5” because the condition expressed in line 11, “$number == 5” (the value of $number is equal to 5), is false. Because it is false, the code in the else statement is executed. You may find that you want to test multiple conditions, and that making multiple if/else statements is inefficient. Thankfully, you can utilize “else if” statements to append additional blocks of code that you want to execute if other conditions are true. &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Conditional Statements&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt; ?php$number = 7;if ($number == 5) {\techo \"The number is 5\";} else if ($number == 7) {\techo \"The number is 7\";} else {\techo \"The number is neither 5 nor 7\";}?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;The above code will output “The number is 7” because the condition of the “else if” statement on line 13 is true. Note that if previous “if” or “else if” statements are true, further “else if” statements that are true will not be executed. Comparison operators are the symbols in the “if” statement condition parentheses. So far, we’ve only used the “==” operator. However, there are several more operators that you can use.             Operator                  In words                  Example                    &lt;                  Is less than                  $X &lt; 5                    &gt;                  Is greater than                  $X &gt; 5                    ==                  Is equal to                  $X == 5                    !=                  Is not equal to                  $X != 5                    &lt;=                  Is less than or equal to                  $X &lt;= 5                    &gt;=                  Is greater than or equal to                  $X &gt;= 5      Here is an example of the greater than operator in use: &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Comparison Operator&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt; &lt; ?php$number = 6;if ($number &gt; 3) {\techo \"The number is greater than 3\";}?&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;The above code will output “The number is greater than 3” because the value of the variable $number is greater than 3, and that is the condition that is being tested. If you set $number equal to a value less than or equal to 3, nothing will be output. ","categories": ["PHP"],

        "excerpt":"   Apple’s Genius Bar ad campaign made its debut during the Olympics last month, with the purpose of showing off Apple products and attracting consumers in need of tech support. The ads, which I will include below, consist of comical interactions between Apple Geniuses and clueless customers. Many critics are disgusted that Apple made customers appear too dumb to run even the simplest of programs on user-friendly devices like the Macbook. Sometime in the past week, Apple silently removed all traces of the new ads from their YouTube channel and their commercial page on the Apple website. Although Apple has not spoken publicly about their decision, we can assume that  it had had something to do with the negative feedback and (relatively) poor quality. They still have advertisements from late 2010 on their website and YouTube account, suggesting that age had nothing to do with it. Ads released prior to 2010 are no longer shown or hosted by Apple. Supporters of the ads exist, and they insist that the ads did an excellent job of telling non-technical Apple customers about their support options. They also point out that there are indeed many people, especially the middle-aged or elderly, that struggle with technology, and Apple targets these people more than companies like Microsoft do.

        "title": "Nokia Introduced the Lumia 920, Faked PureView Camera Technology",
        "excerpt":" Nokia unveiled the gorgeous new Lumia 920 on the 5th of this month, and there’s no denying that it’s impressive. Compared to its predecessor, the new Lumia has a higher quality display, a better camera, and a faster processor. Plus, the Lumia has built-in wireless charging support. The camera makes use of PureView algorithms and a special suspended lens to stabilize images and videos, but it was falsely advertised in one of their commercials. While the body design is identical to that of the Lumia 900, it is available in three new colors: Sunshine Yellow, Lipstick Red, and Slate Grey. The screen is a different story. The Lumia 920 ‘s 4.5 inch Nokia PureMotion HD Plus display sports a resolution greater than that of standard HD screens. In pixels, it’s screen is 1,280×768, and standard HD is 1280×720. If you do the calculations, it’s tied with the 326 PPI of the iPhone’s retina display. The camera is a satisfactory 8-megapixels, and it has a “floating lens” that helps hold the image steady. Most significantly, however, is the PureView software processing that all images and videos go through. It increases image stabilization up to 50% more than high-end digital cameras. Nokia even released a commercial showing off their PureView technology, but all of the footage was faked. In the ad, the Lumia video is supposedly shot by a man riding a bicycle, but it was actually recorded by a fancy video camera mounted in a van. See below:    After news of this broke out, Nokia admitted their mistake and released a real side-by-side video comparison of footage shot with and without PureView. It’s still quite good:      The Lumia 920 will sport a dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor. This is the same processor that phones like the HTC One X and the Samsung Galaxy S3 use. Users can expect extremely fast responsiveness.   The wireless charging works just like you&#8217;d think it would- just drop it on the stand and the phone starts charging. The only catch is that you have to place the phone on it&#8217;s back. In an effort to make wireless charging more popular, Nokia is working with the Coffee Bean &amp; Tea Leaf and Virgin Atlantic to start putting wireless charging stations everywhere.   As is made obvious in the above image, the Lumia 920 is running Windows Phone 8. It is the third best mobile operating system out there, in my humble opinion. You can read all about the new features in Windows Phone 8 over at Business Insider. There is, rather appropriately, an emphasis on photos on Windows Phone 8. The greatest downside of this operating system is the limited selection of apps available. ","categories": ["Cool Gadgets","Hot News"],

        "title": "How to Free Up Space on the Mac Start-Up Disk",
        "excerpt":"After a long period of time a Mac computer may prompt you with an aggravating error message:  At the first glance a lay user may get confused by the error message and wouldn’t know the cause and the solution of the problem. But after looking at the error message thoroughly we can quickly reach the conclusion that the hard drive is running out of space and something should be done to get rid of this message. We have to delete files from the Mac OS X hard drive to get some quick free space. But wait a second, the message doesn’t clarify which files to delete and which ones to store! It is obvious that we can’t delete the important files no matter how large they are. System files are required to stay on the hard drive, and personal documents and media should be readily available. The Startup-Disk or the Mac Boot Volume (in other words) needs a good amount of desired space to work efficiently. So to grasp the required space for the boot volume we have to analyze the amount of undesirable files and folders. Once the unwanted files &amp; folders are permanently wiped out we will end up having free space for the Mac start-up disk. How users can frequently check the Start-Up Disk of Mac: Start the Mac and go to the Finder icon. Click it to open. Upon opening the window, locate the Macintosh HDD. With the keyboard buttons, hit the ‘Command + I’. A window will be displayed on the screen. This window displays the general information regarding the Mac HDD. Among the items featured are the: “HDD Capacity and Available Space.” (Encircled in the image). The memory figures will make the occupied and free spaces clear. How do you create free space by deleting the unwanted data on your Mac? Trash folder is useful but generally ignored: Trash-bin is one of the most neglected and often used folders on a Mac. We do regularly trash small and big files but never cares to empty the trash itself from the garbage. I confess to not having a habit of deleting the trashed files from the folder. But how about if you and I make a regular habit to visit the trash to see if any files needs to be restored and then empty the trash. This would result in saving at least a little amount of free space for the OS X boot volume. Squeezing the size of old files: At this point in time the older files on your Mac need to be archived to reduce the size of the files. You can also move these archived files to optical media like DVDs or a USB which can be accessed later. Clearing error reports on Mac: Macs are smart machines and they produce a log report every time an application goes through some error. These errors are saved in files called ‘Log Files’. Although log files may not be too large or may not occupy big space on the HDD, the collection of many log files should be avoided at all times. Just like log files, the temporary files and caches files should be monitored and sometimes deleted. If you have been avoiding the presence of these files for long period of time, then you must act now to delete them permanently from the OS X and help the boot volume enjoy some more free space. Un-Installing: Every application, widget, and game that comes under the unwanted and unused applications category needs to be uninstalled as soon as possible. By doing this, you can save a great amount of space. Create a new partition: With the disk utility you can easily divide the Mac OS X HDD into various logical or test partitions. This will separate the boot volume partition from the rest of the drive and you can easily shift your media like iTunes music folder, iPhoto library folder to the other partition. This way, the Start-Up Disk will gain some more free space for its operations. Other optional ways: Although these steps may be optional for a user, the data on a Mac can be cloned to another media or backed up on an external hard drive. This will not only free the space on the hard drive but will also ensure the restore of the data in an event of a system or hard drive failure Using tool to eliminate the bulk amount of garbage data: If the presence of garbage data on a Mac exceeds too many GBs, then a user may also utilize a clean up tool to speed up Mac OS X. The tool works to clear any kind of unused and unwanted data from the hard drive and it also provides good speed and performance for Mac OS X.

        "title": "What You Should Know About Cloud Computing and Data Security",
        "excerpt":" When setting up a new computing system for your home or office, you might decide to start employing some cloud computing techniques. As with any computer system or program, you need to be on the lookout for security issues. Plenty of Internet hackers and dubious characters are looking for any possible ways to obtain your personal information.   Bringing in Outsiders According to the article entitled &#8220;Three Cloud-Computing Data Security Risks That Can&#8217;t Be Overlooked&#8221; by Slavik Markovich, one of the biggest dangers out there comes from the fact that outsourced individuals now have access to the information of many companies. They are essentially able to go around standard home security features and be welcomed right into all of your company&#8217;s information!&lt;/p&gt;         Changing Servers This Cloud Security Alliance Article (CSA) goes on to explain that the location of the information also fluctuates. At any given moment, it&#8217;s difficult to know where all of the company&#8217;s information is. When you&#8217;re unaware of a location, you are also opening yourself up to possible attacks. Furthermore, it&#8217;s likely that you have some sort of security or monitoring devices implemented on your business based program. However, when data is constantly moving around, it can be extremely difficult to keep track of everything. You might wind up creating an even bigger nightmare and monster for you and your company.           Ability to Control Not only is some of the information essentially set off to unknown areas when you use a cloud computing system, you are actually sometimes limited in the amount of control you can assert. According to Network Computing&#8217;s article &#8220;Cloud Enthusiasts Worry About Data Security&#8221; by Robert Mullins, &#8220;When asked about their ability to monitor their cloud service, only 20 [percent] saw an improvement while 22 [percent] reported a decline, and most reported no change.&#8221; Clearly, this does not happen in the majority of cases. However, you need to be aware that there is at least a chance of losing a decent portion of control.  Resolving the Issues Ultimately, when you choose to implement a cloud computing system for your business or company, you&#8217;re just going to have to deal with some of the effects. All systems have their own flaws that have to be accepted by the users. However, you can be certain to keep track of data as much as possible, and be aware of what you put out there into cyberspace. Additionally, you should consider hiring a computer and web security professional to be a part of the team. When something is wrong or you have a concern, a member of your staff will be able to offer expert advice and solutions.&lt;/div&gt;               Don&#8217;t be terrified of cloud computing, as a system like this can certainly offer a lot of value and ease for your company. However, as with most computer systems, you need to be aware of the potential issues that could arise. Do your best to always stay at least one step ahead of the cloud computing game!                  Donna Mencher writes about technology, e-commerce &amp; more at http://travelinsurance.org.

        "excerpt":" Creating iPhone applications has been an attractive activity for both budding entrepreneurs and creative minds. Built by Macintosh, the iPhone is a device that reunites the functions of a media player, of a mobile Internet platform, and of a personal digital assistant. An application is a program that is downloaded and then set up on a mobile device and permits it to do a certain number of tasks including sending text messages for free, helping the iPhone user keep track of their weight, or finding nearby restaurants. In order for an iPhone application to become popular, it must feature innovation, a user-friendly design, and utility. The creation of an application for iPhones can be summarized in five steps.   First, take a look at the list of all the applications that are accessible on iTunes and conduct a research on those that are popular. Once you have come up with a short list of popular apps, review them in order to find any conceptual tendency and also to see whether there is any area of application development that has been neglected or underexplored.Second, start designing the app. During this process, you must remember that your app will face fierce competition from other identical applications. Consequently, try to avoid making it too intricate as this would discourage new users from installing it on their mobile devices. The majority of iPhone holders have a demonstrated interest in things such as YouTube, emails, or music. So you might want to consider merging the different interests of iPhone users in your application.&lt;/p&gt;         Third, begin writing the code for your iPhone app. In general, apps for Macintosh products employ Cocoa programming, which is a software programming platform. Even if there is a variety of online tutorials and books that are available on the market, you may easily spend weeks or months learning how to properly write a code. If you are relatively unfamiliar with code writing, you ought to recruit a freelance technician so that they can complete this task on your behalf. This is clearly less risky than trying to write the code by yourself and jeopardizing the introduction of your application to the market.           Fourth, put the app through a period of trial. This can be done in two different ways: you may upload the application to your iPhone and then attempt to run it or you may simply ask less tech-savvy iPhone holders to try operating it. If there are minor issues such as any bugs or clumsy issues in the design of the application, then you ought to be able to fix them in no time. However, if you find out that there are major concerns, then you ought to retool the design of the app.           Fifth, after making sure that the app operates without any problems you may upload it to the Apple App Store on iTunes. Begin to advertise the application on related online communities and foster websites to conduct reviews on the application. You need to handle the reception to your application. Each time that there is a comment made on iTunes App Store, on both the message boards and the discussion threads on the Apple website, or in fan magazines, make sure to take it into consideration. This should help you improve the potential future versions of your application.           As you may see, the development of an iPhone application does not require any technical computer knowledge. Instead, it simply takes a little bit of time and a certain degree of engagement. Creating iPhone applications could be an easy way to earn money on the market of applications.

        "title": "4 Suggestions for Embracing a Mobile Workplace",
        "excerpt":" Today, many people are searching for ways to bring their work on the road and stay productive while they travel. Online file storage and sharing services finally make that possible. They’re an appealing alternative to USB external hard drives that can often break or become lost. Read on to find out how you can stay connected to technology, yet untethered while you see the world. Stay on Task Fortunately, you can still handle your deliverables even if you’re across the country from your coworkers. Choose to either upload your files via a desktop platform or online interface so you can transfer them via your own laptop, or while you sit in an Internet cafe. Sometimes, your superiors might be resistant to the idea of you traveling while there’s work to be done at home. However, when you use a reliable file storage system to upload your projects and presentations for your coworkers to see, you’ll prove that it’s possible for you to meet deadlines even in the face of differing time zones or countries. Lighten your Load Whether you’re traveling to the next town, or across the world, it’s a relief if you can tote around everything you need without feeling overburdened. When you use an online service to upload and share your files, you can have the peace of mind of knowing that you can access your files from wherever you are without having to bring along extra computer gear in your luggage. Find Places to Connect There are several iPad and iPhone apps that enable you to find Internet access by zip code, country or city (although it’s a good idea to have a list of places that you can go online before you leave your home country). These apps fit with the spirit of spontaneous decisions. If you decide to take a quick trip to a neighboring country during your usual travels, you can quickly find out where you can get online with just a few swipes of your fingertip. Communicate with Coworkers Before you head out on your travels, make sure that you’re open with coworkers about where you’re going to be, and for how long. Also, try to give them an idea of when you might be online or uploading files for them to view. If you plan to use password protection for your files, ensure that anyone who also needs to view them is informed of the password in a secure manner. Today, it’s more possible than ever to tackle your workload from almost anywhere that has an internet connection. Online file storage and sharing services let you keep all your important files in a single location so that you can view them whenever you want, and let people you work with do the same. At first, your absence from a traditional office environment might take some getting used to, but once you prove that you’ve figured out all the main necessities before your departure, you should be more able to showcase that you can thrive in a mobile workplace.

        "title": "The Anatomy of Mountain Lion and Mac OS X Data Loss Concerns",
        "excerpt":"   It comes as no surprise to us that Mountain Lion has many key changes when compared to the previous OS X versions. But there are a few among them that are highly significant and worth noting. Mac OS X has always provided its users a fair share of security that makes it superior to Windows; however, nothing was said about it in earlier versions. But the cornerstone of this eighth major release seems to be security and Apple has highlighted this throughout its communication about the OS. Gatekeeper This is a security setting in ‘System Preferences’, which ensures that your Mac does not install any software from untrusted sources. This means that you are always protected from malware attacks. You can configure the Gatekeeper to allow only the applications from Apple’s App Store. Trusted sources usually have a key provided by Apple that helps to distinguish them from other sources. Sandboxing The technique is used to make apps run within their own protected memory space (does not mean same bit of RAM), which means it cannot affect any other component in the system. This was done for Safari in the earlier versions. Now, the current version sandboxes Mail, FaceTime (videoconferencing), Reminders, and Notes. Another feature called Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) makes sure applications do not use the same portion of RAM always, and it has been optimized to make everything this way. iCloud iCloud is a means to integrate your Mac with a range of commonly used devices. The data generated by iCloud-enabled applications is synchronized and saved on every device that runs the application. These applications are Contacts, Notes, Mail, Calendar, Safari, etc. You can save files in the same way on your hard drive. However, to enjoy the benefits of iCloud, you need to specify your choices before saving. In addition, Windows users too can synchronize their data between multiple devices (such as iPhones and iPads) using the iCloud control panel specifically designed for Windows. Sharing Mountain Lion allows you to connect to your social networks easily. With this feature, you can post to your social networking sites directly from various applications such as Notes, Photo Booth, Safari, etc. Apple has also developed an API for third-party developers to allow you post to your desired social network from any relevant app. There are several other enhancements to the earlier versions (such as Notifications, Spaces, full screen apps, and more) that make Mountain Lion more robust. In spite of a bounty of cool stuff, Mac users still need to worry about one thing: data loss. Bad programming, hardware failures, and improper shutdowns are common reasons for data loss on Macintosh. If your system files get corrupt, it may lead to further kernel panics and boot failures. To recover from these data loss disasters, you might have to turn on a data recovery app that can effectively run on the latest OS X ‘Mountain Lion’ to retrieve all your lost, deleted, or formatted data.     Vishal is a geek, Mac expert and a data recovery professional. My motive is to make user aware about the Mac data recovery loss and recovery choices. ","categories": ["Mac"],

        "title": "Google Gigabit Could Get Gloomy",
        "excerpt":"As Google pushes forward with its plans for gigabit fiber Internet access, I wonder if they are considering the repercussions from competitors. As they offer a free 5MB downstream of the Internet for anyone willing to pay the $300 installation price, this could greatly tear into profits of competing ISPs in those areas. Could Google wind up in court yet again for being innovative?    1. The Competition – It seems that if you’re not with Google, then you’re against them. Since the search engine super-giant threw the hat into the ring of mobile computing, everyone not supporting Android has barked up Google’s tree. If Google is true to offering free Internet and residents eat up the idea, this could be extremely troublesome for the competition. Before long, a class-action suit could be filed against Google for trying to monopolize the market or some other technical jargon that can be spun by money-hungry lawyers. It’s not Google’s intention to rob various ISPs of potential income using trickery devices, but it’s to promote interest in the service. If a service provider wants to quell the damage wrought by Google’s advertising team, it needs to devise its own form of damage control. Any marketing campaign can be countered if the competition can dedicate themselves to providing a better deal to consumers. 2. Microsoft Revisited – Do you remember when Microsoft had to divide itself up because too many competitors were complaining about the power the software mega-giant wielded? Could a similar instance happen to Google? It is ridiculous to imagine that if a company grows too large, our law enforcement officials can say when it needs to be reduced. Isn’t that the whole premise of living in the “land of opportunity?” Instead, we pay too much attention as to not hurt anyone’s feel-goods that we sacrifice much of what this country was built on. Tolerance doesn’t mean “to placate.” 3. More than Internet – One of the features offered through fiber optic from Google is the Fiber TV service. Now, they are planning to pummel cable and dish networks. If the service is better, then so be it. If cable and dish competitors want to stay in the game, they need to develop innovative plans themselves. If it’s not cost effective to install fiber optic lines to replace aging copper, then something else will need to be addressed. 4. Adaptation – As with any activity on a network, you’re only as fast as your slowest router. If you have a 1GB connection, it doesn’t mean that you’ll stream data from YouTube at the same rate. Communication servers and routers between your Internet connection and YouTube’s actual server could have considerable lag on them. In order for consumers to get really excited about 1GB downstreams, Google needs to devise a plan relating to latency on aging communication lines. I still have full intentions on paying Google to install fiber optic at my home as soon as they come in the area. I just hope it’s as fast as it looks on paper. It may be years before some of these services begin seeing the decrease of a customer base, but it could still happen. As time and fiber progresses, competitors will slowly come from the wood-work to spell trouble for advanced technology. They always do. As many companies seem to believe that innovation comes from lawsuits, Google will need to tread lightly. Although we may think some of these lawsuits are insanely frivolous, it is still cause for concern about where and when the next volley of them will appear. Personally, I believe Google should give away free Internet if they can afford to do so. If the competition is hurt by this practice, then the competition needs to come up with a better plan.     Jason Miner plays a vital role for www.blogcarnival.com.  He is an expert in writing topics of different categories.  He is helping the carnival team to grow &amp; working on making this an even better place for bloggers.   ","categories": ["Google"],

        "title": "How to Safely Sell, Return, or Trash your Computer by Removing all Data",
        "excerpt":"There are a plethora of instances that necessitate complete removal of sensitive information that was previously written to your media storage device. You may require disposing of your old Mac or selling it to a stranger. Before disposing of this computer, it is essential to clean the data off your old drive to reduce the chances of an identity theft. Accidental disclosure of data may occur in any of the following scenarios:   You sell your Mac’s hard drive without securely erasing your confidential data on the drive.  You return your impaired drive to the manufacturer without using any appropriate media destruction practice.  You disposed of your computer that had a functional drive.To secure yourself against such incidents or avoid becoming a victim of identify thefts, you should rely on appropriate data destruction methods. The best way to counter data remanence and remove all traces of sensitive data from your storage media is disk wiping. The method of wiping typically involves overwriting the hard drive with all 0s, all 1s, or any random sequence of 0s and 1s. This overwriting can be done multiple times for a higher security. Recent studies have shown that a single overwrite is sufficient to securely erase your media.  Most of us confuse file deletion with file wiping or disk wiping. When you simply press the delete button on your keyboard or even empty the Trash bin, you do not end up erasing that file. Instead, the contents of the file remain intact on your hard drive in their original place. This can give a chance to intruders to get access to these files by using simple recovery methods. The Mac OS accesses files using pointers. A pointer gives information to the OS regarding the start and end of a file. When a file gets deleted, a pointer to this file is removed, which indeed marks the disk space occupied by the file as ‘free’ or ‘available’ space. The operating systems follow this tactic as it is relatively simple and fast. Performing complete erasure of data may take significant overhead. On the contrary, deleting a pointer consumes less time. The file system can no longer view the deleted file, and thus cannot locate the contents of the file. However, this file can be still recovered until the space occupied by it gets overwritten with new data. It is possible for a file recovery program to comb through your drive and recover this file. In case the OS partially overwrites this file, only a part of it can be reclaimed by the recovery program. Hence, file deletion does not ensure data destruction leaving you at the risk of disclosing your private or confidential information to unauthorized users. In order to prevent such information leakage, you should wipe your hard drive before letting off an old Mac. There are plenty of professional Mac disk wipe utilities on the market nowadays. With the help of these tools, you can securely erase all remnants of confidential files on your hard drive beyond the scope of recovery.     Author: Vishal, just shared the need of File Eraser utility for Macs to ensure no confidential data is hampered after letting off the Mac/hard drive.   ","categories": ["How To","Uncategorized"],

        "title": "How to Organize Your Apps on an iPhone",
        "excerpt":" The iPhone is an amazing piece of technology. If you’re still not privy to this ubiquitous trend, then you should know that people use their iPhones to connect with their family, get directions, and run their day to day lives. Many people could not imagine their lives without an iPhone. One of the biggest benefits of the phone is all of the apps available for download. There are literally thousands of apps to choose from, no matter what you need to make your life more fun, manageable or even profitable. Unfortunately, too many apps can spell trouble, causing the phone to become cluttered and unorganized. It can also be overwhelming for those who are new to technology. If this sounds familiar to you, then here are four steps to organize your apps! Get in the Know You should know how many iPhone applications you have, and what type of applicants they are. The easiest way to check is to connect your phone to your iTunes program. After syncing your phone to your iTunes account, open the Apps icon in the navigation bar on the left. Here, you will be able to view all of the apps installed on your iPhone. This will give you a good start in cleaning up your cluttered phone. You can organize your applications in any number of ways, alphabetically, program type, or date installed. Now, you should have a clear idea of your situation. Uninstall Lets face it, a lot of us installed useless applications, while others have become out of date. Check out the last time you have used the app. If it has been months, or even years, consider removing the application. Also, when uninstalling apps, look for duplicate applications. There is no need to have two weather apps or two sports apps – one app per subject should suffice. It’s likely that one or two of these apps were downloaded for some kind of promotion (“Get a 5% discount by downloading our app!” – Sound familiar?), and if that’s the case, never fear! You did your part – they obviously haven’t given you any reason to stay on as a customer! In the worst case scenario, you can always download the application again. Maybe it’d be better on a different platform, such an iPad. Create Folders After you have consolidated your apps, you should create folders. Though it is a tedious process, it will be the most important process in getting organized. You will need to create folders based upon your supplied parameters. For example, you can make a folder for finance, photography, games and so on. You can put up to 12 apps into a single folder, and this should suffice when wanting to clean up your iPhone screen. Remember, this process might take a long time, especially if you have a lot of apps on your phone, but you can likely get all your apps onto a single screen if that’s your goal! Efficiency This tip only applies if you don’t mind having multiple pages of apps to scrolls through. And for us in this camp, it is not uncommon to have dozens of applications. So, put the most used apps on the first or the second page – this makes them much more accessible. Remember, most apps are not used daily (for instance, an Airline app or Netflix), so it only makes sense to move those to the back of the line. Also remember that you’ll thank yourself later if you put closely related apps together – credit card apps, for example. The iPhone is a great tool for our busy lives. Nowhere is the iPhone more impressive than in the applications arena. Unfortunately, a lot of people go crazy and download too many apps, which becomes difficult for them to organize. Luckily, thanks to a little program called iTunes, you should be able to organize your applications in no more than an hour or so.     Author Jason Harter makes apps his life, as he develops them and makes a living by selling them.

        "title": "Finding the Right Hosting Environment for Your Photographs",
        "excerpt":"   Professionals who work in creative media, such as photography, architecture, or film, have followed the path of most 21st-century businesses: They depend on the Web to drive sales and cull new opportunities. Unlike other businesses, creative professionals are especially dependent on the quality of the images shown to potential customers, all while creating a web presence that is fast and easy to use. A film maker, for example, does himself no favors if his sample videos hang and need to reboot every few seconds. A wedding photographer will sell fewer photos if her site doesn’t allow the user to quickly scan through the selection. It is vital for creative professionals to find the right cloud host. According to Eelco van Beek, CEO of Jitscale, an IT management organization that works with creative professionals, photographers, artists and other creative types should consider the following issues when looking for a hosting environment: *Backups: does the provider guarantee backups of your data? *Bandwidth pricing: most providers charge for the bandwidth that is used to share your artwork. This could become expensive if your artwork is popular on the Internet. *Quality and Terms of Service: what guarantees does the provider offer in terms of availability? *Intellectual Property: do you still own the data you upload to the provider? *Shared or dedicated hosting environment: shared hosting can be inexpensive but usually has less performance and reliability than dedicated hosting. *Latency: is the network connectivity of your provider close enough to your client base? For example if most of your clients are in Europe, you want to consider using a hosting environment which is located in Europe. *Security: how well does the provider secure the environment you use? A cloud storage solution with a Content Delivery Network is also an important consideration, added Carson Ward, a consultant with search marketing site Distilled. “When your content is image-heavy, traditional hosting is just too slow and unreliable,” Ward said. “If your images blow up in Europe, that small hosting server all the way in Ohio won’t cut it. CDNs ensure that your images load fast, no matter where in the world your fans are.” Speed matters, especially with high-resolution images, but it’s only part of the equation. “Traditional site hosting just won’t handle a surge in traffic, and your site will go down under heavy traffic — right when people are trying to view it. CDNs will automatically adjust bandwidth, continuing to serve images quickly even when your content goes viral,” Ward said. To best store media files in the cloud so they upload quickly, van Beek pointed out a trade off between quality and speed. “To get the best quality online you will need to use larger media files and thus it will take longer to upload. Getting a high-speed connection to the internet will make it much quicker but will be more expensive,” he said. For customers who are downloading the data, it’s important to separate static media files (pictures and/or video) from the dynamic content (text articles) on your site. Full size pictures should only be offered as a separate download and initially shown as thumbnails or lower quality versions. In the end, the storage media you choose will depend on what the most important deliverable to your potential customers will be. ","categories": ["How To"],

        "title": "Smart Ways to Choose a Gadget",
        "excerpt":"   When it comes to buying gadgets, a lot of care and consideration needs to go into any purchase. While quite a few brands put out products with similar functions, an equal amount cannot measure up to the competition. Knowing the difference will make you happier with your purchase, as well as keep you from spending money on something that you won’t want. Here’s what you need to know in order to make the smartest purchases on gadgets! Figure Out What You Want  The firststep is determining what gadget you are specifically looking for. More importantly, what you can expect this particular device to do for you. If you want something that works like a portable computer but has the interface and functionality a smart phone, then newer tablet releases should fit this need. Knowing what you expect from the device will help you narrow down options as well, as there are plenty of electronics that offer less functionality and/or features than others. Release Dates  Once you have a product in mind, pay close attention to the top of the line. These companies are known to release a couple of new gadgets a year to improve or add more features to their existing popular products. If you are hoping for a feature you haven’t found, it might be on the way within a year or so. Or, if you are looking to save some money, the latest version should knock the price of the previous model down to make it more affordable for you. Shop Around  The key is really shopping around. You have to both look online and in stores in your area for whatever you’re looking for. This is going to give you a good idea of the average price of this device, as well as where you might be able to save some money. Many online locations offer coupons for free shipping or percentages off your order. A little bit of patience and determination can end up saving you big. Be sure to do a Google search for any coupons or promotions (try “Best Buy + Coupons” for example, if you’re shopping there) to make sure you get the best deal possible. Reviews  Public opinion is important to any company that makes gadgets, but it should also be equally important to you. For popular devices, you should be able to find hundreds of reviews on various websites offering you unique insight into how products work and/or what people love or hate about it. This will give you the opportunity to test drive a device through other people’s experiences without ever making a purchase. Take advantage of what people have felt inclined to write, and understand what makes the bad reviews bad, and what makes people really love this product. See which of these you can relate to the most, and you should be able to determine the gadget in particular that suits you the best.   Jenda Grimes writes about technology.

        "title": "Intersteller Space Travel: is it Possible?",
        "excerpt":"   For years now scientist have been plagued with the following question: how do we leave our solar system and enter a new one? There have been many theories for exotic new space engines each one more effecient then the last one. The purpose of this article is to explain several different methods of travel. The current method of space travel is highly ineffectient and will take 168,000 years going at its constant 28,300 Kph. And let me remind you that that is to Alpha Centauri (4.3 light years away), the closest star to us. To go to stars that are just a bit further would take millions and to reach the other side of the galaxy would take 3.636364*10^9 years. By then our home would be long gone. But fear not, there are other ways to travel through the universe. Here is a list of just a few.    Photon sail: What a Photon sail is a sail that is about 100 miles in diamiter that would be used to tow a spaceship. Like a sail boat, the sail would be pushed by a source except that in this case it is a highly concentrated beam of photons (A.K.A. a laser) instead of a gust of wind that would be propelling it. This method would allow us humans to travel at 64 million Mph or about 10% the speed of light. Fission explosions: A fission reaction occurses when an element becomes to heavy and splits into 2 smaller elements. When this happens it creates a large and extemely violent explosion. This is the exact type of explosion that would occur in a nuclear bomb. The reaction would cause a series of explosions each one propelling the spaceship futher. These explosions could be extremely dangerous but when used correctly could have a monumnetal effect. This method of travel’s top speed would be about 32 million Mph or about 5% the speed of light. Though this method of travel is much slower than a photon sail it is much more effectient because it requires much less resources to power. This series of explosions was origanaly proposed in project orion. Fusion explosion: Origionaly proposed in project Dedalues a form of spacetravel using a fusion reaction opposed to a fission reaction was proposed. What this fusion reaction does is at the base of the the space ship there would be a smaller sized partical excellerator with several Heleium-3 particles excelerating. Then in the the center of the excellerator would be a single dueterium (Heavy water) atom floating. As the He-3 particles spin they start to pick up speed at the same rate. Then at the same time they release smashing into the Dueterium particle in the center. This would create a much larger explosion then the fission reactor and would use alot less fuel than a conventional rocket. It is estemated that fusion fuel the size of a grain of sand would be the equvilent to 10 gallons of conventional rocket fuel. The dueterium would be aquired from sea water and the He-3 would be extracted from Jupiter or saturn. One of the advantages of having a fusion reactor over a fission reactor is that one could go to new system and “refuel” by borrowing their rescources. This can also be done with a fission reactor in theory but one would have to go mining to find the radioactive elements needed for the reaction. The He and H need for the fussion would be much easier because it is estimated that 98% of all matter in the universe is H and He. There is no estimations for the average speed of this spaceship but is estemated that it would be alot more powerful than the fission reaction considering that a hydrogen bomb is about 50 times more powerful than a atomic bomb. Antimatter explosions: Following the same concept read in the last 2 posts one could use Antimatter as an expolsion source to propel a ship. When Antimatter comes into contact with matter it creates a violent explosion. The only effectient way to obtain antimatter is to create it in a hydron super collider. To put antimatter into perspective, it takes about 10 milligrams of antimatter to take us from earth to mars. And 1 milligram is about .001 the size of an M&amp;M candy. Though that may not seem like alot it does take massive amounts of energy to obtain and store this amount of antimatter but the payoff is worth it. Antimatter produces Gammarays which happen to be the smallest wave lenght and the most powerful know to us. That being said Gammarays are so deadly they can melt through iron as if it was butter. Because we are talking about Antimatter, you can just stuff them in a bottle like all other fuel, Antimatter has to be stored in an electomagnetic field to make it less volitial. This Antimatter space ship could travel at a whooping 448 million Mph or 70% the speed of light. Blackhole tow: One final theory is the Blackhole tow. What a black hole does is it warps space around it to create a sort of spacebubble. What this spacebubble could do is bend space around the space ship to tow it. This Blackhole would compress the space in the front of the ship while expanding it in the back. This would make it so the spaceship in theory never moves at all, but instead pulls space towards the ship. This would be devestating though if you were to approach the because it can tear through it in a matter of seconds. This blackhole tow would allow you to “travel” at speeds faster than light. The reason why this doesn’t defy Einstien’s theory of special reletivity is because Einstien stated that nothing(energy or matter) could move faster than the speed of light, this isn’t moving faster than the speed of light. In fact it isn’t even moving at all. It is simpling pulling the fabric of space towards you. For example lets say that you have a ball sitting in the middle of the rug. You could either walk over and pick up the ball, jog over and pick up the ball, run over and pick up the ball, or you could just not move at all and pull the rug towards you with the ball sitting on the top untill it reaches where you are sitting/standing.

Amongst most internet users, this is a real problem. While you are on this site you are probebly getting tracked by several companies. But fear not, there are good guys in this war to. You just have to be able to find them. A company that has recently been created called “Ghostery” has a tool that you can use. They have a program that you can use to protect yourself. This program is completely free to download and requires little installation. What Ghostery does is it tracks the surveys that are tracking you and shuts them down. It allowes you to select which websites you want to track you; so if you want to be tracked by a site by google, but don’t want unknown sites to track you, you can do that. Or you can set it so that no sites whatsoever can track you making you heavly protected. The best part about Ghostery is that even if you block all of the sites or some of them it showes you which ones it is blocking and which ones it is letting track you.

        "title": "Seven Considerations for PHP Hosting",
        "excerpt":" PHP is one of the universal scripting languages for web content delivery. In fact, many popular systems run on the PHP language:WordPress, Joomla, vBulletin and phpBB, to name a few. Because of its popularity, businesses often need the support of PHP services when choosing a cloud host provider. PHP is naturally supported by both the Linux and Microsoft web hosting platforms, so whichever operating system is chosen, PHP can be used on the servers. Easy Installation    The PHP coding engine is included with LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) environments. Microsoft IIS supports the language naturally with newer versions. For older versions of IIS, the PHP engine is a quick installation with little configuration requirements. The PHP system uses a flat text file to configure an environment, so there are no difficult interfaces to support. Cost Microsoft environments are expensive, but PHP and LAMP systems are affordable, especially when the business pays for cloud hosting costs up-front. For instance, Rackspace has the Ubuntu operating system with Apache installed, which are both free operating systems for Linux. The costs associated with Linux are a fraction of the cost to set up Microsoft applications, and plenty of developers offer free tools to install on the server. Performance PHP is used in even large corporate web environments. The language is linear, and does not use much server overhead to execute. PHP is great for high traffic websites, and it’s a common language for software developers, so finding a contract or permanent software developer to join the IT team is not difficult. Security Security is always an issue when allowing Internet traffic to access a web server. PHP has several functions and configurations to facilitate a safe transaction environment. PHP hosting environments also allow for SSL certificates, which provide encryption for transactions with sensitive customer information. Support Support is integral for a web-based business, and a good cloud host provides PHP support when LAMP servers are installed. The host will support any security breaches, network hardware failures, or in some cases, PHP errors that stem from a server configuration issue. The cloud host support team should be able to identify any issue that’s related to the host server configurations and permissions. Bandwidth LAMP servers use very little resources, but bandwidth is also a consideration for connectivity support and performance. Cloud computing hosts serve data to users based on geolocation, so bandwidth use is minimized while connectivity performance is maximized. A good cloud host offers data centers everywhere in the world, so even international customers have a fast user experience on the business website. Number of Domains PHP supports any number of domains on the web server. PHP is a lightweight language, so there is not a lot of overhead to support multiple sites on one server. This is a consideration when using dedicated servers in the cloud. Theoretically, the server can host hundreds of websites using the PHP scripting language as a backend engine and provider. Not all considerations are created equal, but the IT manager should ensure that each of these considerations is researched when finding the right host provider.     Jennifer Marsh is a software developer, programmer and technology writer and occasionally blogs for open cloud company Rackspace Hosting.

        "title": "Making Stop-Motion Animations is Easy with iStopMotion for iPad",
        "excerpt":"  Almost everyone has watched a stop-motion movie at some point in their lives, whether it be one of Wallace and Gromit&#8217;s escapades or Gumby and Pokey&#8217;s adventures, and some of the more creative of us have tried to film their own stop-motion animations. Those that have attempted to create their own animations know that the recording process is very tedious, and the editing process is even more difficult. Until recently, software supporting stop-motion animation was trying and buggy at best, non-existant at worst.   Boinx Software hopes to change that with it&#8217;s revolutionary iPad app, iStopMotion. With iStopMotion, casual users can quickly and easily whip out their iPad and start snapping photos of any object or material and start animating it. You can even perform the entire editing process without leaving the app!    Boinx was kind enough to send me a review copy of iStopMotion for the iPad, and I thought it was definitely worth sharing. In the past, I’ve had to use frustrating video editing programs like iMovie to make stop-motion animations, but they really aren’t designed to handle sequences of separate frames that last for fractions of a second. iStopMotion streamlines the entire process of capturing frames and combining them into a video. When first opening the app, you are greeted by a cute animation of clay figures showing you how to navigate the interface, which consists of a library of current and past projects and provides buttons accessing help and managing projects. There’s even a “Theater” for viewing other users’ creations and sharing your own.      Upon creating a new project or opening an old one, you are presented with the capturing and editing interface. It&#8217;s very straightforward: tap the capture button and a frame is added to the timeline. If you don&#8217;t like it, you can delete it. An extremely helpful feature that you won&#8217;t find in capture software not designed for stop-motion is onion skinning. By default, a &#8220;ghost&#8221; of the last frame is shown over the current camera view to help you adjust the scene. This assists in creating fluid animation and fixing your camera position when you inevitably bump it and everything goes haywire!   That brings me to another unexpected feature. You can use the camera of other devices, including iPods, iPhones, and other iPads. This is done by downloading the iStopMotion Camera app on the device to be used as a camera. This is the same application that lets you use your iPad camera with the Mac version of iStopMotion.   Since a significant amount of time can pass between captured frames, the lighting conditions can change. Because of this, you should adjust the exposure and white balance of your camera and try to film inside, preferably in a room with consistant lighting. Otherwise, you might notice flashing in your final video. I&#8217;ve found that locking the exposure helped prevent the iPad camera from changing the brightness when something light or dark moves into the scene (like your hands).   Unrelated to stop-motion, the app can capture time lapse videos. This is a feature that other premium apps are dedicated to, and it almost makes iStopMotion worth purchasing in itself.      After you&#8217;ve captured a sequence of frames, you can begin the editing process. The editing tools aren&#8217;t particularly advanced, but they definitely get the job done. You can delete frames, reverse sequences of frames (useful for making looping animations), copy frames, and past frames. You can navigate your timeline either  by using the timeline&#8217;s elegant 3d interface, or by sliding through the overview bar that can be enabled in the settings.   There is quite extensive support for adding audio. You can record your own audio and insert it anywhere along the timeline, or you can import music from your own library or Soundcloud&#8217;s database. I chose to add an 8-bit Indiana Jones theme.      One problem I ran into was that the audio had a few seconds of silence at the beginning that outlasted my entire animation. That wasn&#8217;t going to do! Fortunately, you can step the audio track forwards or backwards, but the process is a little bit tedious. Being able to see the waveform helps somewhat.      There are plenty of options for exporting your final video. You can have it to your camera roll if you want to edit it in another app (like iMovie), mail it to yourself, or upload it to services like YouTube. I elected to upload my short video to YouTube. The process was fast and seamless.   Overall, I think that iStopMotion for iPad is a fantastic app for creating short stop-motion videos, and, giving the limited amount of competition, it&#8217;s probably the best at what it does. The capturing process is easy, the editing tools are decent, and sharing finished movies is fast and simple. I would recommend this app to any casual creatives, children and adults alike, looking to have some fun animating anything from Playdough to Legomen!

There are many different sites for group collaboration, such as PBWorks or Hackpad, and choosing a suitable one is a challenge. Particularly for our personal projects, we tend to enjoy straightforward, easy-to-use, and free software. One of the most straightforward is Asana.           Asana User Interface     Asana Features Part of the beauty of Asana, is that it has a surprising lack of features. As project management software, we tend to get overloaded with features. The essence of this website is to provide a task management application. Asana gives its users a very straightforward project task management, much like Things. It organizes the group’s to be completed tasks, as well as group milestones and other checklist items.           From Asana's Website   Pricing Setting up an account for your group is free, and you gain access to all of the features. If you want to expand to a larger group, Asana has a payment plan for handling larger groups. Altogether, this application is one of the cleanest, straightforward task management systems you can expect for its price.

        "title": "OneTab for Chrome Condenses Tabs into a List, Reduces Memory by 95%",
        "excerpt":"   If you’re like me, you typically have over 30 tabs open. This leads to shortened titles, high memory usage, disorganization, and other sources of aggravation. I recently stumbled upon the Chrome extension OneTab, which lets you condense all of the tabs in any given window into a list of links for later reference. You can then re-open a tab, or restore the entire window of tabs. Since the extension essentially closes dozens of tabs, it frees up all of the memory that those tabs were consuming. Therefore, it can be used to free up memory when your computer is running slow or when you want to open new resource-intensive applications. Though their web page claims a 95% reduction in memory, I’ve experienced a smaller, but still significant, decrease in RAM usage. Chrome, without even having a web page open, can waste hundreds of megabytes of memory (depending on running extensions, version, et cetera).    OneTab also implements tab sharing functionality. From your list of saved tabs, you can generate a page with a QR code that can be scanned and opened with mobile devices. This is similar to features already available in Chrome and Safari, as well as services like SendTab, but it can be more convenient as it doesn’t require signing in and it can transfer large collections of tabs at once.           I got a bit carried away!   Through usage, I’ve discovered that I think of OneTab tabs  as a secondary type of bookmark. Some websites don’t deserve a space in my precious bookmark collection, but they’re useful enough for a current project that they don’t necessitate deletion either. Utilizing OneTab, I can store websites or sessions for later that are related to what I’m working on without cluttering my bookmarks bar.   You can install OneTab from the Chrome Webstore HERE ","categories": ["Browser"],

        "excerpt":"This book, Rework, caught my eye a year ago, but I had never gotten around to reading it. Emblazoned on the front cover is a quote, “Ignore this book at your peril.” Statements like these could always be indicative of dogmatic fanboyism. Nonetheless, the reviews praised this collection of (for the lack of a more appropriate word) pericopes that offer advice to handling many of the daunting challenges facing beginners to the world of business.             Rework, for those who are unfamiliar, is written by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, two of the key people behind the company 37Signals. Hansson is rather acclaimed for his work in developing Ruby on Rails, although this book doesn’t discuss his exploits in this endeavor. Nonetheless, 37Signals boasts project management software ([Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/?source=37signals+home&amp;__utma=1.2038167074.1370320648.1372304684.1373961073.6&amp;__utmb=1.6.10.1373961073&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1371498531.3.2.utmcsr=google      utmccn=(organic)      utmcmd=organic      utmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=10259637)), contact management software ([Highrise](http://highrisehq.com/?source=37signals+home&amp;__utma=1.2038167074.1370320648.1372304684.1373961073.6&amp;__utmb=1.12.10.1373961073&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1371498531.3.2.utmcsr=google      utmccn=(organic)      utmcmd=organic      utmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=36608928)), and group collaboration software ([Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/?source=37signals+home&amp;__utma=1.2038167074.1370320648.1372304684.1373961073.6&amp;__utmb=1.18.10.1373961073&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1371498531.3.2.utmcsr=google      utmccn=(organic)      utmcmd=organic      utmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;_utmv=-&amp;__utmk=5539123)). 37Signals has made quite a name for itself, not simply from the book _Rework (or from any of its other books), but from the pervasiveness of their three simple tools. The book Rework channels much of Fried’s and Hansson’s personal experiences from growing 37Signals.      Content The content of Rework is divided into sections that deal with different phases of company development. From dealing with Promotion to Culture, it covers the many complex facets of a fledgling company. These meticulous parts of a company are not endemic only to software development companies, as Hansson and Fried attempt to make a book adaptable to any other enterprise with similar intentions. Now while these complex facets are covered, the book is by no means a tedious, rigorous textbook for starting a business. Rather, it is laced together with short summaries of advice, often intertwined with useful tips and memoirs. Often, Fried and Hansson cite their experience working at 37Signals as objective evidence to back their wisdom. This, coupled by terse, straightforward dialogue, present a very readable and informative book. Now, with this idea in mind, it shouldn’t be perceived that Rework is the end-to-end solution of the entrepreneurs of the world. There is some wisdom that can be interpreted as sheer arrogance or some advice that can be founded on 37Signal’s “luck” rather than reasoning or logic. In some cases, the book takes a turn to a point where it almost is shouting at the reader, “Ignore conventional wisdom!” Yet, “Ignore conventional wisdom,” is not a suitable replacement for this book. It is, nonetheless, a very informative read that can open another perspective to starting a company. The memoirs and simple, straightforward messages it offers still leave the reader with a clearer sense of direction, in terms of starting a company. But, it should not be the only source of advice that a fledgling entrepreneur should refer to, but rather one of a handful of selected books. All-in-all, Rework is a very well written novel. It is a must read for anyone entering the business fray. Its insightful, sometimes unconventional advice is conveyed in a simple, straightforward manner. But beware, the advice may not always be logically sound; I encourage any reader to fully consider a supposition made by the book, and analyze the proposition carefully. The authors put a lot of care into this compilation, as their passion shows in their short, terse, memoirs. Enjoy! ","categories": ["How To","Review"],

        "title": "Apple’s iOS 7 – A Total Overhaul?",
        "excerpt":"   With only a few more days left for the upcoming release of iOS 7, avid users of Apple products have been on the edge of their seat waiting to get their hands on the newest mobile operating system to be used for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. Since the original iPhone release way back in 2007, iOS 7 characterizes the biggest change in Apple’s iOS so far and as to all the brand new features and fresh design that comes with it represents a major overhaul. While it is noticeable that iOS 7 is very much different from iOS 6 or others of iOS, this change was definitely purposed to bring out a better mobile device experience. The first remarkable change you would notice with the new operating system is the new user interface, flat icons compared to that of iOS 6 or lower which is embossed, redesigned icon logos for each app, Phone App with incoming notification banner and a panoramic wallpaper for the Home/Lock Screen. The dynamic live wallpaper background livens up the screen but at the same time gives it a clean, minimalist look. As always simplicity is beauty. The parallax 3D effect of the background also gives it something to be curious about since the layered look of the screen enhances the way the flat icons look, giving it more depth and perspective. Aside from the total design transformation, other significant changes in this OS are features like new noise cancellation settings to reduce ambient noise during phone calls, “slide to power off” button, a new look for twitter icon and Control center user access. Since the purpose of iOS 7 changes is to satisfy demands from different age group and users, they came up with an operating system that doesn’t only contain all the great features of iOS but to also address all the issues encountered before. Apple certainly threw in a little bit more by putting in Airdrop. This great feature lets you easily share photos, videos and contacts with the trouble of sending it through email or text. Just a tap of the Share button through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and you’re off sharing your contents in a breeze. Of course when Apple design and redesigned the iOS 7, what they have in mind is how important social media is. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other type of Social Media that are famous today are very much in demand. And who wouldn’t use the camera when social media is involved? Apple didn’t miss to focus on these demands, with new camera filters, different shooting formats like still, panorama and video, iOS 7 truly delivers. It is also easier to browse through all your captured photos with enhanced photo library the features smart grouping according to place and time. Add in a little bit more with iCloud Photo Sharing that lets you automatically see posted photos, comments and videos in a shared content stream. These are just amazing features that keeps you updated with every aspect of your life. Without a doubt, iOS 7 is not all about fun. Apple also considered businessmen who want to rely on their mobile device for its portability. Even with a fast-paced life, iOS 7 keeps up with the Multitasking feature that automatically updates your apps during power-efficient times. Browsing is also made easy with the new Safari web browser which is now equipped with unified smart search and new tab view letting you effortlessly scroll from tab to tab. And last but not the least, aside from the new look, Siri also gets a new sound. The old and reliable assistant now has a more natural sound and even a female and male voice to choose from. These features are generally what we look forward to and one might even say that the total overhaul is what we’ve been waiting for, just like a breath of fresh air. ","categories": ["iOS"],

        "excerpt":"  You may find keeping track of both your budget and your expenses a very intimidating task that may wear you out. This may lead you to find trivial excuses to do without this aspect in your daily life. However, you need to realize that if you are a working individual and plan to make purchases, whether small or heavy ones, you will need to adopt a systematic approach that will help you keep a detailed account of where you end up spending your money and draw up an accurate budget that will help curtail unwarranted expenses. This holds especially true in cases of debt relief. However, manual calculations and accounting can be a daunting task and therefore, if you are the owner of an iPhone,  you have a plethora of apps at your disposal that can help you in your financial endeavors by keeping a tab on your expenses and budgeting. These apps are especially beneficial when you wish to manage your personal finances.       Mint:      This can easily be considered as one of the most popular apps in the App Store and there is a plethora of people who rely on this app to keep their personal finances straight. Every financial account that you hold are trying to keep a track on can be controlled effectively in one app alone. You have the option of having your bank and credit card account linked to the app. This can be beneficial in several ways as the app helps you stay more organized by providing a comprehensive list of your incomes and expenses. One of the best features that Mint possesses is its ability to keep you organized and stand true to the budget that you may have drawn. It constantly guards your accounts held in banks and credit card companies so that it can keep notifying you if you happen to near your limit for the budget set. This app can be increasingly helpful especially if you are going through the phase of debt relief.             BUDGT:         What makes BUDGT unique when compared to the app mentioned above is the simple fact that you are not compelled to offer any kind of personal information to this app. In fact, it is also completely alright if you wish to skip the step of providing login information. BUDGT, as the name suggests, is an extremely straightforward and easy to use app wherein using the app is as simple as entering the amount, the budget for which you would like prepared and keep feeding the app with information pertaining to your incomes and expenses and you are good to go. However, the fact that BUDGT does not take into account the detailed information on banking and credit card statements makes it less user friendly to people who are in  a financial crisis. Therefore, this app works best if you already have your finances sorted.             Spendee:         This app has only been launched pretty recently but has managed to create headlines with its incredibly easy to use interface. Usually, with other apps, it takes a good amount of effort to keep a record of your daily incomes and expenses. However, this is not the case with Spendee. It is quick and completely hassle-free. The main feed of the app is known for displaying the latest financial entries that you have made. This ensures that you double check whether all the entries made are appropriate. You get access to a detailed analysis of your spending activities so that you can take corrective steps, if any.   Lamar Thomas is a financial analyst and a social media geek.

        "excerpt":"Online music has become a leading market. With services like Spotify, Pandora, Bop.fm, Soundcloud and Rdio, online music sharing, streaming, and collaborating has reached a point of technological ease. Yet, there remain a few caveats with online music. Finding new music is not always an easy task. While software like Spotify recommend you new music and Pandora’s platform is founded on finding new music that follows a genre or theme you like, the results can be so hit or miss that you would find yourself context-switching every 10 minutes. Additionally, computer speakers generally do not provide high quality sound. This means there are limited options for those who want to listen to new types of music as well as maintain high quality sound (which is pretty much everyone who likes to listen to music). Aether, a company with a mission statement of “making products that learn about you so they can serve you better,” has developed a cone-shaped speaker that intelligently analyzes what types of music you listen to and finds new music for you to listen. The cone is a minimalist speaker with a handful of manual features. The cone works like a radio, as you turn a dial around the speaker to find music that you like. When you find a song that piques your interest, perhaps an old, nostalgic track or a non-conformist, emotional tune, you leave the cone to play the song. As you continue to find music you like, the cone grows more wary of the genres, artists, and titles you listen to. By learning the user’s preferences, the cone is able to find new music from various online sources and stream them through high-quality speakers.           Side View of the Cone             Back view of the Cone                     In addition to finding new music, the cone can also play specific songs. All it takes is to push the button in the center of the speaker and say the song title and artist name. The cone keeps track of song requests as well. Finally, if you don’t like what the cone has been playing, you can turn the dial to a different song and the intelligent speaker will take note. The simplicity of features, the graceful layout, and the intelligence of the software synthesize to create a remarkable product that makes listening to music refreshing as well as enjoyable.

        "excerpt":"In this set of tutorials, I will demonstrate how to get oriented with the Python programming language. Over the past few months, I have grown acquainted with the language. The uses of Python extend into many disciplines, such as research, academics, game development, and web application development. The Python language is rooted in cleanliness of code, organization, and execution. If you are unfamiliar with programming, you will find Python a great place to start in order to craft useful applications. Now, I’m going to assume that you have Python already installed onto your computer. Since I am a Mac user, the following tutorial will have a bias towards setting Pip up on a Mac system. Installing Pip Pip is a package manager for Python. What is a package? Well, developers throughout the world are constantly developing new Python-based technologies to make development, analysis, research, or testing easier (just to name a few uses). These packages range from analysis based tools to internet web bindings (if these terms don’t make sense that’s okay – once you start building Python code and experimenting with the language, you’ll understand heuristically the terminology). Pip is a useful little tool that allows you to install packages easily and globally. This means, from an Python text editor or IDE, you can import a package into your Python script. To install Pip, first download the get-pip.py file from here. Next, open up Terminal or Command Line on your computer. Navigate to the directory containing the get-pip.py file (which is probably the Downloads folder).

        "excerpt":"As you get into Python, you may be looking for new Python IDE’s or looking for a text editor that satisfies your initial concerns; simplicity, effectiveness, and cost are some examples. When you are scouring for the right editor, be sure to consider the following: what will I do without this editor/IDE? Will you be more stressed when you can’t effectively debug your code? Will you be lost without an in-text editor navigation system? All of these are aspects you should consider before dropping $50+ on an IDE. While $50 is a small piece of change in the short-term, if the software you pick up is one that you don’t use, you’ll be setting a precedent in your development career: keep buying technology until something works. For the new Python developer, PyCharm seems like the best option. IDE’s are always a good option, and for budding developers, IDE’s help when trying to figure out bugs or coding errors. Additionally, PyCharm is a beautifully styled IDE with lots of cross-language support. Plus, the layout and functionality of the IDE is pretty sophisticated, making it both visually and technically appealing. But, PyCharm carries a price tag to complement its excessive features for a new Python developer. While the new Python developer might be able to justify the use of such an IDE, he or she may be thinking that such an IDE is not suitable to his or her respective development needs. So where does this developer go? There are free alternatives such as Eclipse + PyDev. There is even a PyCharm community edition. These are all acceptable free solutions. But, there is a simple IDE that can easily be installed and implemented using pip (which you hopefully installed). It is called iPython Notebook. Installing iPython Notebook Installing the notebook is much easier done than said. Open up Terminal/Command Prompt. If you have pip installed, you should be good to go with installing the notebook. Type the following command into Terminal/Command Prompt.           This command installs all ipython dependencies as well.   Done! pip should install all of the iPython notebook dependencies. Running iPython Notebook To run iPython Notebook, enter the following into Terminal/Command Prompt.           This script will start the iPython Server   This will begin the iPython server. If the server is successfully running, a new browser window should open up at the following address: http://localhost:8888/tree           This tells you where the server is running. If your browser doesn&#8217;t open up http:/localhost:8888/, then you can manually enter this address in your browser   Congratulations, you have successfully installed iPython Notebook!

        "excerpt":"Coin is a product with the much sought after goal of reducing wallet size. With rewards cards, gift cards, credit cards, and debit cards, it is easy to lose track of which card does what or where each card is. Coin centralizes all of your cards into one credit card via an iPhone Application. Coin looks like a credit card and functions similarly. The only differences are that Coin is an electronic card that accesses card data on all gift cards, credit cards, rewards cards… Coin’s goal is to reduce wallet size and organize all of the cards in your life. To achieve this, Coin has streamlined your phone with your credit cards. To use Coin, the owner first downloads an iPhone application. Next, the user attaches a small widget-like accessory (shown below) to the iPhone device and begins swiping in his or her cards. Finally, the user can use Coin like a normal card, expensing whenever necessary. When a user wants to alternate between cards, he or she just taps the golden circle to select which card to use.           The small white device connected to the iPhone is where you swipe in cards   Keeping to the streamlined philosophy between the phone and the card, Coin includes a Bluetooth system. In case you were to leave your card behind, your iPhone device reminds you that the Coin credit card must not be near by. It achieves this because the Coin and the iPhone are in constant communication via a low-powered Bluetooth signal. Perhaps one important consideration before indulging into this new, chic technology is the security repercussions of centralizing all of your credit card information. While there is relatively little information on how Coin encrypts/protects user data (for a good reason), it is a good idea to think about the advantages of card centralization versus the risk of putting a lot of financial resources in one basket.

        "title": "iStopMotion 3 for Mac Makes Stop Motion Animation a Breeze",
        "excerpt":"Full Review Making inanimate objects move on their own is a magical sight that has fueled my small hobby of stop motion animation for years. I used to use iMovie to compile all of the photos from my digital camera, and then I transitioned into the iStopMotion iPad app. But now, I think I’ve found the epitome of amateur stop motion animation software. Boinx’s iStopMotion 3 combines core frame capturing features with great compiling and editing functionality all in one streamlined interface. When you create a new project, the first thing to do is select what camera you are using. iStopMotion supports a small range of Nikon and Canon DSLR cameras, but the best experience is found with their companion app Remote Camera, which is available on all iOS devices. This convenient app supports adjusting focus, exposure, and white balance. Both orientations seem to be supported, but switching between them is a little bit glitchy.  One of the most basic features that any stop motion software should have is onion skinning, where the previous frame is overlaid on the current camera feed as to make relative movement easier. iStopMotion gets this right with an opacity adjustment and the option to overlay multiple frames at once (useful if you’re trying to follow a path or pattern smoothly).  In addition to onion skinning, there is a rotoscoping feature that lets you trace frames over a video. This is fantastic if you are trying to emulate a walking cycle or recreate a scene from a video. Alternatively to capturing every frame manually, you can record a time lapse that will automatically capture a frame at a set interval. You could try to do stop motion this way, but it is best used to capture interesting changes in the world (the sun setting, people walking). A recent update lets you capture from your desktop, so coupled with this time lapse feature you can do things like record yourself drawing and play it back as a time lapse. I tested it with an hour of browser activity, and it led to some pretty funny results! One drop down lets you fiddle with tilt shift settings that apply a blur that makes large scenes look like tiny toy sets. It’s difficult to design a cool background for your scene, so the compositing functionality is welcomed. The two tabs let you choose a foreground and a background. Using chroma key technology that replaces a background color with an image, iStopMotion makes it possible to put your actors on the moon! It may have been my lighting or background, but this feature seems experimental and not quite functional enough for use in production. Foreground images are simply overlaid on the frames with no problems. [ ](/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/compositing-tabs.jpg) Once you’ve captured all of the frames in your video, it’s time to edit it. iStopMotion provides some basic editing functionality with tools like reversing sequences of frames and moving them around. It also supports adding a soundtrack, which makes it possible to sync up your frames with music and make a groovy music video. Although iStopMotion’s editing features are very bare bones, it does support exporting into more advanced video editing software such as Final Cut Pro or iMovie for finishing touches. Boinx updates iStopMotion frequently with great new features like desktop recording, additional camera support, and bug fixes. They have an official support forum, decent documentation, and phone support. Overall, iStopMotion 3 is a great piece of software that is certainly worth the price for animation enthusiasts of all ages. There are very few bugs, and the feature set is complete.

        "title": "Python Basics 101 &#8211; Part IV: Defining Functions",
        "excerpt":"Functions in Python can be easily defined and called upon throughout a directory of files as well as a single file itself. This tutorial will briefly demonstrate how Python functions work as well as defining a Python function. The advantage of defining functions is that a script or application could be dealing with several instances of pretty much the same purpose. When you define a function, you can call it multiple times, thus eliminating the need for coding what the function does every time. Python has some pretty cool functions within its various imports which we will also look at. Setting Up the Application Go ahead and launch iPython Notebook. If you need a review of how the notebook works, feel free to check out here. Next, rename the program “Functions.”           Ready to Go   Writing the Code Next, we’re going to type in some code. I’ll explain what each element is responsible for later.           A simple function   Now there are several other functions at play that we should address first. The function that we defined is called function1. The general organization of a function is:             def function(variable):&lt;/p&gt;                     #what variable does&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;                           In our above example, the user inputs two types of information: a number and a word. The raw_input() function is one way of getting the user to input information. Because our function is a function of 2 data types, we include a comma in between each component of the argument (the argument, for definition&#8217;s sake, is what is in between the parentheses next to a function).                                   Next, we want our function to do something. Our above function uses some external functions in part of its defintion. First we take use len(). What len() does is it takes the length of a string inputted and outputs its integer length. The next function is int(). The raw_input() function stores data as strings which cannot be added together (as they are not numbers &#8211; while they could be numbers, the computer doesn&#8217;t recognize them as numbers but rather as words or strings of letters). The function int() converts the variable within the argument to integer form (only if the argument is a number &#8211; you can&#8217;t convert a word to an integer).                                   The final part of our function adds the two numbers together. Then, it invokes print and returns the sum of x and y. But, this isn&#8217;t the end. We need to call our function. Defining the function only defines it; it doesn&#8217;t implement it. Thus, we use function1(word, number) to call the function on the various pieces of data inputted by the user.                                   And there we go! Functions in Python!

        "title": "Vertu Constellation &#8211; A High-end Luxury Smartphone",
        "excerpt":"          The tan edition of the phone   The Constellation is the newest phone released by the England cell phone company Vertu. While most commercial smartphones vary in price between a few hundred to almost a thousand dollars, the Vertu Constellation costs around $5,700. At about 6x the industry average for a device that is always growing in ubiquity, what does sinking ten grand into a cell phone get you? Phone Build The Vertu Constellation, like all of Vertu’s phones, is a handmade device made out of luxury materials. For example, the backing of the phone is not a case; it is a leather backing instead of the standard aluminum or plastic covering. The company claims that a single craftsman, using the finest leather in England, assembles the device (and eventually signs his or her name into the phone). Following the leather, on the side of the phone, there is a ruby button, used for special services (see below). Additionally, the phone’s skeleton is crafted out of a titanium alloy, and the phone’s surface sports a sapphire crystal screen.           Turned On Vertu   Hardware Hardware for the Vertu Constellation sports some interesting features. Other than the luxurious materials invested into crafting the device, it boasts noise cancelling technology for the user. In addition, the screen has been polarized to minimize reflections and glare. It boasts a front (1.3 MP) and rear facing (13 MP) camera as well as top-notch sound features. The Vertu Constellation boasts Android software specifically designed for the phone itself. It has a battery with a standby life of 405 hours and an Internet use time of 7 hours. It has 32 gb of Internal memory as well as a 1.7 gHZ Snapdragon Processor. The operating system is similar to many Android builds (it runs Jellybean), except for the two distinctive features that separate the device apart from any other commercial smartphone (and perhaps justifies 75% or more of the cost): Vertu Life and Vertu Certainty. Vertu Life and Vertu Certainty           Constellation marketing campaign   Vertu offers two services that last for the duration of the phone’s ownership: Vertu Life and Vertu Certainty. Vertu Life basically turns your phone into a club pass into pretty much every premier club, sporting event, and cultural events. The phone works as a pass into events such as Wimbledon, Formula 1, or even Cannes Film Festival. This service exudes an arrogant aura of aristocracy, as a select group of wealthy phone owners gain priority access into some of the present-day’s most important world events. Nonetheless, owners of the phone paid for this type of service. Vertu Certainty is another feature that has more practical uses. Certainty offers a variety of security and protection services to the phone’s owner. These services include, a partnership with a corporate asset management company, personal global tracking, and a gold standard insurance policy (for ransom, kidnappings, etc… You can probably guess what kind of people own this phone). In addition, owners of the phone get global Wi-Fi access, Encrypted Phone data, 24/7 Live Support, and Anti-Virus/Anti-Theft protection. This phone offers a myriad different protective services that apply anywhere throughout the world. This was achieved by Vertu’s various partnerships with global companies in data encryption, Wi-Fi access, etc… One feature that wasn’t included in the Constellation but is almost a landmark piece of software in Vertu technology is the Concierge service. The Concierge service is a Vertu call center that is available 24/7 for communication. They help Vertu clients find hotel rooms, inform users about cultural norms, and even make online purchases. The Vertu Concierge helps phone owners get into exclusive events as well as get out of a possible political situation. This feature is included in the Constellation’s older brother, the Vertu TI (~$10,000 phone). Conclusion The Constellation is an expensive piece of technology. But, it has its speciality uses and seems to be worth the cost, especially for business executives, politicians, and other frequent ransom targets. A personal opinion on the Vertu phones: the Constellation is perhaps the first Vertu phone that doesn’t look dog ugly. For paying several thousand dollars, I’d expect a client would like his or her phone to be aesthetically appealing.

        "title": "What Swift Means for the Future of iOS and Mac Development",
        "excerpt":"[alert variation=”alert-info”]Grab a copy of Apple’s free Swift programming book on the iBooks store[/alert] At the 2014 WWDC, Apple announced a new programming language called Swift. With inferred types, simple syntax, and an interactive editor (“playground”), it is easier to learn than its predecessor, Objective-C. Also, is offers performance enhancements over alternative languages. But will Swift have a drastic effect on the iOS and Mac application development process? The transition between programming languages will be long or nonexistent, as Objective-C is backed by thousands of libraries and frameworks. Furthermore, programs and apps written in Objective-C are expensive to rewrite, and many developers will choose to continue to update old code rather than opt to rewrite it in Swift. Plus, Swift and Objective-C can live together in the same applications, as Apple was careful to point out. This means Objective-C can stick around and do the more rigorous work while Swift handles the interface or user interactions of an application. Objective-C has it’s fair share of quirks, but Swift’s are worse. Although faster to write and shorter, Swift supports poor/lazy programming practices with every class being public, inferred types, and the absence of semicolons. Developers in teams will have to implement rigorous coding standards to avoid illegible and buggy code. Swift helps with this in some aspects, however, with mandatory brackets around conditional statements and single type arrays. In most cases, iOS and Mac development will remain the same. Because Swift is so closely related to Objective-C to the point that the two languages can run together, developers can continue to program in Objective-C. More adventurous developers will continue to use the same IDE and even the same libraries in their Swift applications. There isn’t a major shift. Since Swift is a developing language, developers will have the unique experience of giving feedback to Apple that will effectively shape the language for the future. As it is in development, though, there are many bugs and crashes to be endured. Despite this, developers should play with the language and help improve it for their own benefit.  The key change will be in developers. Because of the interactivity of Playground and the straightforward nature of Swift, development has been made possible and more inviting to a larger range of people. Developers familiar with scripting languages like Python or Javascript will have an easy time picking up the new language and starting projects in what might have seemed a discouraging environment before. But most importantly, kids, students, and casual hobbyists will more feasibly learn valuable programming skills and create their own projects. They will, however, be crippled without eventually learning some Objective-C. ","categories": ["App Development","Apple","iOS","Mac"],

        "excerpt":"JavaScript developers (or any developer that uses JavaScript) know that the language can be, at times, awkward and clunky to use. While web developers try to promote agility and lightweight design through their code, languages like JavaScript (which inherits some of Java’s heavy syntax and design) at times seem self-contradictory. To handle JavaScript’s rigorous design while maintaining its powerful features, a new language was born: CoffeeScript. Installation If you have node.js installed into your computer, installing CoffeeScript (along with other JavaScript languages) is relatively straightforward. ** ** Type the above command into Terminal to install CoffeeScript. This uses the node package manager (npm) to install the CoffeeScript module globally. Example of CoffeeScript Code Let’s say you want to define a function in JavaScript (the function is called “something”). The code would look something like this:  In CoffeeScript, you can accomplish this in one line of code.  You would be able to reduce the amount of time spent coding in JavaScript drastically. Additionally, CoffeeScript is far more readable for non-JavaScript programmers. Although the drawback of learning another scripting language to handle JavaScript can be time consuming, CoffeeScript could still be potentially useful for expediting project development. You can check out CoffeeScript here. How to Use .coffee Files CoffeeScript is an intermediary for JavaScript. Scripts written in CoffeeScript are saved as .coffee files. The way it works is you first have to script a .coffee file and compile it into a .js file so you can actually use the program’s contents. To use CoffeeScript, all one has to do is cd to the directory containing a .coffee file. Let’s say you had a file called something.coffee in this directory. Type the following command into Terminal to compile the .coffee file into a .js file.  If you installed CoffeeScript globally using _npm, _then you should be able to run this command.

        "excerpt":"Apple does a clean job of portraying iOS development as a fun, streamlined, and straightforward process. While this may be the case for experienced programmers and developers, the opposite seems to be the pervading opinion about iOS development for beginners. Five or so years back, when I was overly zealous and dangerously naïve about the development process, I considered Apple’s SDK to be the coolest idea ever. But, as I engaged in trying to figure out the code (as well as learn Objective-C simultaneously), I became increasingly frustrated with the set-up. Not to mention that my entry into application development was through self-teaching Objective-C. Altogether,  with my lack of programming experience and my enchantment with Apple’s iOS SDK, this made for a somewhat disappointing and frustrating experience. As a result, I switched to learning Java for application development.           A variety of QuickDialog&#8217;s Features             Quickdialog&#8217;s Forms are an easier version of Apple&#8217;s UI   For developers beginning the iOS development process, it can be difficult to get a mix of programming in with an organized setup. What I mean is that learning iOS development can be a somewhat discouraging process (as I described in my personal experience). Xcode is not the easiest IDE to use. Objective-C is a weird mix of Java-like syntax with C coding and Apple’s UI features. On top of that, there are a myriad services that replace actual development with templates or dragging and dropping UI onto a screen and calling that an app. With such a striking dichotomy of services, the beginner programmer is torn between creativity and simplicity, between learning and ability. This makes learning application development, especially for someone with little or no programming experience, an overwhelming and slightly discouraging endeavor. With my personal ramble aside, let’s talk about a neat little technology called QuickDialog. QuickDialog is a package released by ESCOZ Inc that allows iOS developers to easily use UI elements in their code. The package comes with an assortment of elements that are free to use in an iOS application.

        "title": "Google Shows Off First Project Ara Prototype, Makes PhoneBloks a Reality",
        "excerpt":"At the recent Google I/O 2014 conference, Google announced several new android and chrome projects and goals, with an emphasis on affordability and wearables. But what stood out was the demo of the first modular phone to come out of Project Ara. Around the beginning of last year, an organization called PhoneBloks started a campaign to develop modular phones that would reduce waste. The big idea was that phones with changeable components could be repaired and upgraded, and thus last longer. The campaign and kickstarter went viral and were a huge success, but there was, and still is, much skepticism about the feasibility of such technology. The beauty in modular phone technology is that you can buy upgrades to components of your phone like you can your computer. A popular example is buying a high quality camera for your phone, or swapping your battery out for one that has longer life. Due to this nature, the pricing range of these phones can range from a cheap $50 (default phone from Google with the bare minimum hardware) to perhaps thousands of dollars. Motorola, owned by Google, conveniently declared that they were designing a modular phone of their own under the name Project Ara, and PhoneBloks reached out to them in a partnership. PhoneBloks hopes to create and provide a community that gives suggestions and feedback to Motorola throughout the development process. This development is remarkably similar to Astroturfing, the practice of  hiding the sponsors of a marketing campaign with a “grass roots” organization that saves money and has popularity benefits, and leaves Google suspect. Below is a clip from the keynote showing the demo of the Project Ara prototype: [youtube_sc url=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0He3Jr-fZh0″ title=”Project%20Ara%20Demo”] The demo didn’t go completely smoothly, but simply showing the boot sequence is a great accomplishment. Presumably they have successfully booted it before, but the device isn’t yet reliable. The prototype proves the technology, but it doesn’t show if it is possible to create a production quality phone that will function as planned. As such, skeptics remain critical about the potential of this design and its ability to both function and gain enough traction to attract module designers and have an effect on phone waste. I believe that Google will see this technology through and push it into the market like it has Google Glass, but the reaction to it will likely resemble that of Glass – it’s cool, but will remain in a niche market of developers and reviewers.

        "excerpt":"“It’s a waste of time!” “Do something actually good for you!” “Get off the couch and do something productive for once!” Do these motherly calls sound familiar? Especially if you’re a gamer? Well I have news for your mom and everyone over the age of 30 who thinks video games are a waste of time: they’re not. The following academic studies were conducted recently and indicate that video games have physical and psychological benefits, overall making you a better human being. In November 2013, German researchers released a study they had conducted for two months.  They asked 23 adults with a median age of 25 to play the popular game “Super Mario 64” for 30 minutes a day over a two-month period.  A separate control group did not play any games at all. Using MRI technology, the researchers found that the gaming group had a huge increase in activity in three major areas of the brain: the right hippocampus, the right prefrontal cortex, and the cerebellum.  In other words, the gaming group had better spatial navigation, memory formation, strategic planning, and fine motor skills in the hands. In the same year, the University of Iowa released a study in which its researchers found that video games help slow down the aging process.  Six hundred eighty one healthy senior citizens were given various computer games to play, and in some cases playing video games stalled the natural decline of different cognitive skills by up to seven years. Why? The answer is actually quite simple.  As Jason Allaire, a psychology professor at the North Carolina State University, puts it, “Games are cognitively complex and require mental energy and abilities to play them.  Whenever you do anything that requires mental energy, you’re exercising your abilities -it’s just like if you exercise your muscles, you get stronger.” The next study is truly amazing.  In 2012, New Zealand researchers experimented with the idea that video gaming could be the cure for mental illnesses, rather than the cause (as they have been prematurely labeled).  Their hypothesis was confirmed.  The researchers created a game called “SPARX.” The name stands for “Smart, Positive, Active, Realistic and X-factor thoughts,” which are common strategies in fighting against depression.  In the game, the user would create an avatar to fight the “bad guys” (which represented the negative, automatic thoughts), much like popular video games Skyrim and Saints Row. The researchers split a group of 168 teenagers struggling with depression in half; one would go through regular treatment, meaning five sessions of one-on-one counseling, and one would play the new SPARX game.  The results? Forty four percent of those who played the SPARX game fully recovered from depression, while 26% of the control group fully recovered. So despite supposed connections between video games and killing your brain, these academic stories prove that, yes, your mom is wrong, and you are right.  Video games are actually good for you.

        "title": "Perl Tutorial &#8211; Building a Local Network",
        "excerpt":"Perl is slowly growing out of fashion, despite it’s ubiquitous influence on developing modern languages. Much of Perl’s syntax and structure has been cleaned up and made more accessible via Python, thus many developers would favor Python instead of Perl. Yet, Larry Wall’s creation is still relevant to understanding modern programming. In this tutorial, we’ll build a local network in Perl to showcase it’s ease of networking via socketry. Sockets If you’re unfamiliar with networking, here is a brief overview of a socket. A socket is basically opening a connection on a computer via a port (computers have a certain amount of ports that they can communicate on with other computers). In order to use a socket, you first must “create” one or open it. Then, you must script something that tells the socket to accept incoming socket requests. Finally, you must tell the socket to do something otherwise it’s not very useful. Receiver End We’ll first build the receiver end of the Perl script. This end must be run first in order to create an open socket to receive incoming networks.  Enter the above code into your editor. There is a slight problem though. What if the port is being used? What if you have multiple networks going on or your running a server in port 8000. In that case, we need someway to stop the script if it cannot make a connection.  This script takes care of busy ports. Next, we  need to script the socket to do something when another machine/user tries to make a connection.  What this code will do is whenever something is being received, it will print what is being received into Terminal/Command Line. Now, let’s code the sending end of the network. Sending End Now we want to be able to send stuff over the port for the other user (which in this case would be yourself) to see.  Running the Test For this network to work, open up two Terminal Windows and cd to the directory containing both the receiver.pl file and the sending.pl file. In one Terminal window, execute the following commands:           Execute this in 1 Terminal             Execute this in the other Terminal   What you should see is nothing on one end and a prompt on the other Terminal asking to “Send Messages: ” Enter a message on one Terminal and hit enter. You should see it on the other Terminal. Experimentation Now that you’ve successfully created a mini-network using Perl, feel free to incorporate other features like sending files (which Perl handles nicely) or sending/intercepting messages (and possibly test some encryption methods).

        "excerpt":"YouTube is notorious for its simply dreadful comment sections filled with immature statements and pointless flamewars. Most people just turn a blind eye to this area all together, but what if you want to have a meaningful discussion about a video or want to read some intelligent reactions? The browser extension AlienTube fixes most YouTube comment sections by replacing them with threads from Reddit that link to the video. This enables you to read comments sorted by popularity from a community better known for intelligent discussion. Furthermore, this can be a tool to discover new subreddits that share videos related to your interests. AlienTube searches Reddit for the comment threads to every post linking to the video currently being watched. It organizes them with tabs by subreddit, and it displays the comments in the same format as on the Reddit website, complete with voting and additional commenting functionality.  I have been using this extension for a few months, and I am frequently surprised by the fantastic amount of videos that have associated comment threads for them. When there aren’t any matching threads, the original YouTube comments are displayed, but that leaves you no worse off than what you had before. Sometimes the original creator of the video joins in on conversation on the Reddit threads because they can get better feedback and discussion there, rather than the YouTube comment section. You miss out on this if you only ever see the YouTube comments and don’t closely follow YouTubers. AlienTube is available as a browser extension on all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and even Opera. Install it from the developer’s website at http://alientube.co/ . It’s free!

After you have settled in with a service, you may want to share some music you have found via the platform. Whether it is an independent artist on SoundCloud or a mainstream popstar on Spotify, sharing raises another problem: incompatibility. Wiith the variety of services (Youtube, Rdio, SoundCloud), it can be headache to share songs easily as one has to manage his various music accounts as well as connect in each account separately. This is where bop.fm enters, to fix the frustration of online music sharing. bop.fm is a website with an ambitious goal of centralizing music sharing via the myriad music online platforms. The service is built on the principle that all online music can be shared through one interface, thus releaving any headache of managing seven different accounts. An example would be when you wanted to share a Spotify song to someone who doesn’t have the account, that person would have to create another account just to listen to 1 song. All of this unnecessary work to listen to a single track or share music is bypassed via bop’s website alone.           bop.fm interface &#8211; it boasts sophisticated aesthetics in addition to keeping with its philosophy of simple use and service   Altogether, the idea seems to be an ambitious project, but with the beta version looking as clean, user-friendly, and robust as any of the major online music platforms, it is definitely worth looking into.

        "title": "App Extensions for iOS 8 &#8211; Everything You Need to Know",
        "excerpt":"Apple has always been introducing innovative versions for its operating system iOS. The latest to join this list is iOS 8. Although this iOS version is equipped with features that make room for creation of brilliant applications, recently Apple has announced app extensions which have added a tint of exclusivity to the operating system. These extensions have come as a sweet surprise for app developers who’ve always wanted to extend the functionality and content of a single app beyond boundaries. Keep on reading to know more about the app extensions that have been released for the convenience of iOS 8 users worldwide.   2 Major fixes allowed by iOS8 App extensions Unnecessary duplication of data between apps created by the Open in system and the unavailability of alternative keyboards to Apple are two major limitations of iOS that are being care taken of by the innovative app extensions.  An Overview of App Extension Life Cycle An app extension is basically a specialized binary that is delivered through a containing app. Thus, an device containing an app is all that is required for effectively providing add-on functionality to the extension. In contrast to this, with Mac OS X, any such requirement of an iOS containing app is banished. App extension life cycle is totally unrelated to the its respective containing app and comprises of the following 4 stages:   Users select an app extension  System launches the chosen app extension  The chosen app extension runs  System kills the app extension under focusHere’s a look at the extensions launched for the iOS8: [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″] Share– This is an extension that enables you to share content with other apps and numerous sharing websites. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″] Today– This is a widget that lets you receive a quick update regarding the tasks done in a single day. You can even perform a quick task in the Today view of the Notification Center. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″]  Document Provider– This is an iOS 8 extension that provides access to the file repository and allows you to manage it in a flawless way. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″]  Action– This is an extension that allows you to view and even manipulate content available within the context of another iOS app. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″]  Photo Editing– This is yet another interesting iOS 8 extension that allows you to edit a photo or video within the iOS 8 Photo app. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″]  Custom Keyboard– This is an extension which when installed replaces the traditional iOS system keyboard with a custom keyboard. [icons icon=”check” color=”#0a0a0a” size=”10″]  Finder– Especially developed for the OS X users, Finder allows you to present information about the file sync states.  Choosing an appropriate extension is crucial Since each app extension point is associated with specific APIs and usage policies, it becomes quite essential for the developers to choose an appropriate extension point for the functionality they intend to provide via their iOS app. For example, a keyboard extension by default has no network access and hence cannot share a container with the respective containing app. This is a major limitation and can be easily lifted by configuring the extension properly. Moreover, it also becomes necessary for the developer to abide by the networked keyboard guidelines that are available in the App Store Review Guidelines as well as the iOS Developer Program License Agreement. Running an app extension in a restricted sandbox is highly beneficial It is interesting to note that each iOS app resides in its own sandbox. As one of the major cornerstones of Apple’s security strategy, sandbox plays a vital role in limiting the app’s access to files, network resources, preferences, hardware etc. In other words, the sole goal of sandbox is to limit the possible damage that a compromised app can cause to the entire system. By making the app extension run in a highly restricted sandbox, it becomes convenient to mark the unused APIs with an unavailability macro such as: NS_EXTENSION_UNAVAILABLE. This will cause a failure at the link time. All the newly introduced app extensions have created a buzz among iOS developers. These extensions have created a visible impact on the iOS 8 operating system, offering more features and functions that can aid in developing plenty of cool stuff for the iPhone users. Wrapping Up Talking about security, the above mentioned app extension limitations ensure that your iOS app is protected against any attack from hackers or viruses. All in all, if you’re inclined on enhancing the security and features of your iOS app then choosing from the explained collection of app extensions is what you can do to achieve faster results.   Hi, my name is addison cohen. I am a programmer  and tech savvy professional.

        "title": "Online Coding Environments",
        "excerpt":"An online coding environment is exactly how it sounds: incorporating coding directly into your web browser. Part of the advantage of online coding is that you can access your projects from different computers, making travel-based collaboration more feasible. Additionally, online coding allows for easier collaboration between colleagues working on different aspects of a larger program. This makes file splicing not as necessary because programmers can simultaneously edit files. Now, it is important to note that not all of the coding environments allow online collaboration, and they each offer unique features.   repl.it  repl.it is a free, open-source online editor with a built-in command line. While the features are limited, programmers can find features ranging from LOLCODE to Lua and Python. The editor is strictly a compiler/interpreter, and doesn’t have any fancy features like code completion or macros. You can check it out here.   CodeBunk CodeBunk is a more extensive version of repl.it that allows users to work collaboratively (through text/video chat). The website also allows you to fork projects to Github and supports a wide-variety of languages like Python, JavaScript, and Julia. It is free to make a CodeBunk group project. You can check it out here.    Neutron Drive Neutron Drive is more IDE-esque than the other editors and winner of the 2012 Google Apps Developer challenge. Some of the features that make this service unique include its file navigation system, FTP support, and wide array of programming language support (everything from functional to query/data languages). The best feature of Neutron Drive, though, is its cost. Neutron Drive is free to use, and you gain access to all of these features. You can check it out here.    C9 Cloud9 (C9) is a beautiful online editor that offers both a premium and free version of the environment. It allows you to preview pretty much any file that you’re editing as well as use an online Terminal and in-line IDE debugger. It features a collaborative environment as well and features a VIM/Emacs/Sublime Text mode (for developers that don’t want to solely use the C9 environment and prefer a more text editor feel). You can check it out here.    CodeAnywhere CodeAnywhere includes most of the aforementioned features such as collaboration and a terminal console. The service claims to be the only multi-platform cloud editor, but perhaps one of its most individual features is in the application’s mobile apps that allow CodeAnywhere’s subscribers to keep in contact with clients and program even when away from a computer.

        "excerpt":"While I don’t consider myself to be an avid video gamer, what I find most interesting about the media genre is the story, visual, and audio craft. Depending on the medium, whether it is a console or handheld device, I am interested in the defamiliarization that developers strive to achieve with their gamecraft. When I stumble upon a game that is aesthetically original, I can’t help feeling intrigued. I have always been interested in Simogo’s creative work. As a development firm, every application that they’ve released is imbued with the mystical creativity that indie developers strive to achieve. From Beat Sneak Bandit’s combination of music with puzzle solving to the wistful Bumpy Road, which out of its simplicity and grace smoothly expounds a touching story. Another example of Simogo’s boundary pushing creativity is their Device 6. Combining a text-based adventure with a book-like reading is perhaps one of the most unique and interesting iPhone game experiences. Rather than simple puzzle solving, Simogo forces users to step-back and appreciate the creative genius invested into the application.           Text-based puzzle solving of Device 6   Most recently, Simogo released The Sailor’s Dream. This game immerses in a small pocket universe of an application with dream-like visuals. Users are drawn to explore a world solely for the purpose of exploration. Wrapped with beautiful music, this application moves away from solely creative expression towards creative storytelling. The adventure is more about figuring out a story and less so about progressing through a quest or journey. Reading like a storybook, this application almost turns the user into a character who is living outside of the author. The Sailor’s Dream captures a beautiful sense of mystical, explorative storytelling.

        "title": "Introduction to Stochastics &#8211; A Look at Monte Carlo Method and Hidden Markov Model",
        "excerpt":"Note: This is a paper I wrote for my AH Computer Science course, hence the formality. Preface A stochastic process is a process that involves aggregating results to find patterns in an otherwise random-seeming phenomena. Sometimes we can’t determine exact functions for representing complicated events or processes and rather than assuming everything is arbitrary and random, mathematicians and computer scientists have developed algorithms for modeling these processes and determining trends. While the models tend not to be consistent exactly with reality, as they are simplifying assumptions, they do help us determine trends in things that we would otherwise think are random processes. The Hidden Markov Model and Monte Carlo Method are two different ideas in computer science with a connected goal of determining algorithms although they solve different problems. The Hidden Markov Model is a model developed to understand processes where the effects can be observed but the algorithm is unknown. The hidden process is referred to as the “Markov Process,” and the model is the graphical interpretation of the possible algorithms. The Monte Carlo Method is a class of algorithms rather than a model for visualizing possible processes. The algorithms are designed to compute values that are generally not easy to find via a function through probabilistic sampling. These algorithms, while part of a broad category, follow a general structure of taking a domain of possible input values with probabilities of these values occurring and then using a “deterministic algorithm” (an algorithm that takes gives a unique output for each unique input) to find individual results. The idea is that aggregating all of the algorithm results will maintain some sort of consistent behavior with which we can use to determine the behavior of the object for which the Monte Carlo algorithm was designed. Hidden Markov Process There are a few definitions surrounding what a Markov Process is. A Markov Process is not solely a hidden algorithm. It’s an algorithm that, at each state of the algorithm, we are able to determine the entire history of the algorithm (Ghahramani). For example, consider speech. A person talks with a non-random string of words (because humans cannot be random). We don’t know for certain what word will come next but we can use the previous words to make a guess as to what will come next. This is a Markov Process. Hidden Markov Model The HMM is a model for visualizing a Markov Process. Instead of delving into the mathematics, I will first illustrate how this model works by showing a few examples.           Observe this schematic   Here is an example of the Hidden Markov Model that I came up with. Let’s say Spencer is in a room with n different dictionaries, each of the same language. The problem is that each definition within each dictionary is unique. We don’t know how they are unique but we know that each dictionary has a random assortment of definitions although they all contain the same words. Alex is on the outside of the room. Spencer, with an unknown algorithm, chooses a definition from any of the dictionaries and sends out to Alex to determine which dictionary it came from so he can find what word it is. Alex has no way of figuring out how Spencer is choosing definitions but can say with a certain probability, specifically 1/n, which dictionary it is coming from. Spencer continues with this process and over a finite period of time, Alex will be able to determine the algorithm through probabilistic interpolation. An example given on Wikipedia is that there is a room with a conveyor belt leading out. A genie is within the room with n urns containing some assortment of colored balls and has a hidden Markov Process or unknown algorithm for sending the balls out of the room. An observer, we’ll say Peter, is outside observing the stream of colored balls exiting the room. He can’t determine what algorithm the genie is using because he doesn’t know from which urns the colored balls are coming from (because the colored balls exist in all possible urns). But he can make probability guesses as to figure out what the algorithm is. Consider the following schematic on the left. The long arrow indicates direction while the arrows from urns to the colored circles indicate possible ball orderings. One aspect about the Markov Process is that the genie’s choice of next urn is dependent on the present urn. Monte Carlo Method** ** The Monte Carlo Method is a class of algorithms based on random sampling. Based on the statistical idea that a near-infinite quantity (yet finite) of tests will reveal a pattern and if a near-infinite quantity of tests doesn’t reveal a pattern, we can conclude that it is a random procedure. Let’s say you want to find the value of pi. The ratio of the area of a circle to the area of a square with a side length congruent to the radius of the circle is equal to pi. So we place the square within the circle and proceed to throw grains of rice, each of unit area 1, onto the circle-square body. We continue with this random sampling of points, all the while taking the ratio of number of rice grains outside of the square and within the square to the number of rice grains found within the square. This ratio will be very close to pi once both the square and circle are covered in rice grains. An important aspect of the Monte Carlo Method is that these algorithms tend to follow a general procedure:   Given a domain of possible inputs, determine each input’s probability of being chosen  Use a deterministic algorithm to sample each input and record the output  Aggregate the outputsThe Monte Carlo Method allows computers to quickly calculate all possible outcomes within a reasonable time period. This is a useful procedure especially in situations where there exists uncertainty to human perspective but a computer can visualize with probabilities all risky outcomes. The Monte Carlo Method is one of the defining algorithms of stochastics as it depends on aggregating results from a model. Monte Carlo Algorithm Examples Here is an example I thought of while driving. Let’s say you throw a handful of sand onto a sidewalk and you want to determine each grain’s location. You could start with looking at each sand grain’s trajectory, factoring in its mass and its direction by projecting the grains into three-dimensional space. You could then account for the various directions of forces acting on the flying sand grains. This is wildly unrealistic given all of the anomalous forces that could affect a tiny sand grain, including the gravitational force of every sand grain on each other. We have to simplify the forces acting on the grains of sand but let’s say we reduce it to several thousand varying forces. So, with a rather long calculation (somewhat long for a computer to calculate trajectories for a thousand sand grains in three-dimensional space) we can estimate the locations of grains of sand. An alternate way, by using the Monte Carlo Method, ignores all varying forces that could be acting on the grains of sand. Here is the algorithm I propose:   Assume that all of the anomalous forces are not anomalous but consistent with every trial. Similarly, assume that all external factors are held constant, each handful of sand is equal in mass and volume to the next, and each throw is consistent. These are reasonable assumptions given that external factors don’t vary much, grains of sand are close to being the same, and each throw can be made consistent. Similarly, we are only searching for an estimate, not an exact calculation. Finally, we assume that each grain of sand corresponds to another grain in a consecutive trial. These grains have the same initial trajectory.  Take a handful of sand and throw it. Record the locations in 2-d space of all grains of sand.  Clear sidewalk and repeat step 1 until you’ve collected enough results, whatever “enough” is in your definition. I would say several hundred thousand.  Aggregate the results by averaging the positions of each grain of sand based on their initial trajectory.We should be able to estimate where grains of sand will land given certain conditions because of repeated analysis. In general though, Monte Carlo Methods aren’t straight-up repeated aggregations of experiments. Sometimes there exist models which are repeatedly tested until a general pattern emerges. Applications of the Hidden Markov Model &amp; Monte Carlo Method A Hidden Markov Model is a way of modeling a Hidden Markov Process or an algorithm that cannot be viewed except for its output states. Examples of Hidden Markov Processes include speaking, weather, and financial forecasting. We can use models that view the previous outputs and then extrapolate or predict the next output based off of certain probabilities. The Hidden Markov Model can be used in many different contexts, ranging from AI video game design to stock market predictions. Yet, while the HMM is a surprisingly simple concept, applying it can range in complexity. Generally, applications of the Hidden Markov Model require a physical knowledge of the phenomena that the system describes. For example, if I wanted to design an algorithm to predict stock market movement, I would have to physically determine a relationship between market behavior and its past few states. A connection between the Hidden Markov Model and the Monte Carlo Method is that the HMM relies on a physical correlation to be clear while the Monte Carlo Method can determine a physical correlation via random sampling tests. Let’s say we have a model for a Hidden Markov process but we don’t have a physical relationship (like numbers corresponding to probabilities, etc…), we can use the Monte Carlo Method based on the model to derive probabilities via random sampling. If we have a process that we think we have modeled, and would like to determine the physical correlation, we could run the model many, many times and aggregate the results. The results would then show a probability trend distributed over the tests which we could then use in conjunction with the Hidden Markov Model to definitively determine and implement an algorithm or computer software that predicts process outputs. The Monte Carlo Method isn’t solely for procedures with hidden algorithms or processes. But, it is used when computing a trend or exact value is not evident, timely, or possible within a reasonable time period. It’s easy to run repeated tests and aggregate results, but it is not easy to determine theoretical answers to problems via logical reasoning. Its myriad applications include everything from investment analysis to operations research. Introduction to Stochastics The Hidden Markov Model and the Monte Carlo Method are both part of a discipline known as stochastics. Stochastics is the science of determining or predicting future states with a given probability. While we cannot be one hundred percent certain about future events, we can try to determine the probability (and to a greater extent, the certainty) behind a given phenomena. The Hidden Markov Model is a way of correlating outputs with a hidden process and the Monte Carlo Method is a way of determining patterns in processes that are seemingly impossible to compute or determine. The Monte Carlo Method requires a model to run tests on (which could be the Hidden Markov Model) while the Hidden Markov Model is a way of representing the connection between hidden algorithms and their outputs. These two ideas are fundamental to the discipline of stochastics and have wide applications ranging from bioinformatics, finance, linguistics, and meteorology. Stochastics is a wide field extending into a variety of human and scientific disciplines. Essentially, it is the science of uncertainty, randomness, and probability. The Monte Carlo Method and the Hidden Markov Model are two fundamental ideas in stochastics. Yet, these two ideas are very wide-reaching and contain many different sub-categories for research and software development. When designing software that deals with physically random phenomena, the Monte Carlo Method and Hidden Markov Model are two approaches to use when modeling and designing algorithms to achieve physical results.

        "excerpt":"Google Hangouts formerly set the standard for online video chat, but a new contestant has taken the lead with a service that not only offers flawless video chat, but also a perfectly synced Chrome window between all call participants. Welcome Rabbit to the stage. Recently redesigned video chat service Rabbit broadcasts a Chrome window from a virtualized desktop to all call participants (up to 10). Participants can take turns “holding the remote” (controlling Chrome) to entertain or collaborate with other people. The best possibility Rabb.it has to offer is watching movies or TV shows together with friends on services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, et cetera. Since everyone is sharing the same screen, only one person needs to log in to a premium content service like Netflix to enable everybody to use it. I’m sure this would concern service providers if they found out, and it’s probably against their TOS, but it’s not that different from just watching movies in your living room with friends, so I wouldn’t have any qualms about it. Another use is playing music together on websites like Spotify, Pandora, and Grooveshark. With Grooveshark, for instance, you could collaboratively build a music queue or have someone act as a DJ for other call participants. A third fun way to use Rabbit is to play online games. Unfortunately, since only one person can control the screen at once, playing multiplayer games at the same time isn’t possible, but turn based games or games with levels where you can trade off work well. Alternatively, maybe someone in your group is really good at a game and everyone just wants to watch them play (without going through the hassle of setting up Twitch). The quality of the video from the virtualized desktop is surprisingly good. It is in HD, the audio is smooth, and the interaction lag is barely perceptible. The only gripe I have about the video is that the virtualized cursor is shown under your own cursor, and since they are slightly unsynchronised it is distracting. This is unavoidable though without sending a different stream to the controlling user, and I would rather have a duplicate cursor than lose the ability to gesture to things on the screen for other people. Rabbit works in Chrome, Firefox, and Opera. ","categories": ["Awesome Websites","Browser"],

        "title": "Top 5 Activator Actions That Will Make Your Life Easier",
        "excerpt":"Activator is one of the most popular tweaks for Jailbroken iOS devices for a reason. It is fantastically useful in making shortcuts for various tasks through a multitude of different triggers. The following are some of my favorite actions that I use on a daily basis. I hope that you find them as helpful as I do! To install Activator add http://rpetri.ch/ to your Cydia sources. 1. Replace Home Button Presses With Touch ID  Pressing that home button all the time causes wear and tear that could eventually break it. Plus, it requires more effort to push down on the button than to simply touch it. The latest version of activator lets you set actions for the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and it opens up a world of possibilities. Adding these two actions effectively replaces home button presses, but you’ll have to choose your own action for Siri! Instructions:   Choose where you want to action to work. I recommend “Anywhere” so it works like the home button.  In the Touch ID section select “Single Press”.  Select “Home Button”. Now touching your home button once will do the same thing as pressing the home button.  Go back to the Touch ID section and select “Short Hold”.  Select “Activate Switcher”.There is another Jailbreak tweak called Virtual Home that essentially lets you do the same thing, but it costs money and the fewer tweaks you need to install the better. Plus, Activator is more customizable. The iPhone 5s or newer is required to use this activator tweak. 2. Previous/Next Song Volume Buttons If you’re like me and you usually keep your phone in your pocket when you listen to music, then this is a must have. Rather than taking your phone out, waking it up, and tapping the previous/next icons, just feel for the volume buttons and press them accordingly. Even if you just leave your phone sitting out on your desk, pressing the volume buttons is still faster than waking it up and finding the icons. Note that this will disable the default functionality of holding the volume buttons to turn off or maximize the volume by holding them. I rarely feel the need for that, but maybe it’s indispensable to you. Instructions:   Select “Anywhere”.  In the “Volume Buttons” section select “Down Short Hold”.  Select “Next Track”.  Go back to the “Volume Buttons” section and select “Up Short Hold”.  Select “Previous Track”.  3. Swipe App Icons to Open Different Apps A lot of apps exist in pairs or are very similar to each other. For instance, Facebook and Messenger compliment each other. This action will save you time hunting down for apps and let you embed shortcuts to alternative apps right in your home screen. Just swipe up on one app to open up the alternative app! Instructions:   Select “Home Screen”.  Tap the “More” button.  Select “Icon Flick Up”.  Select the app you want to swipe upwards to open the alternative app.  Tap “Save”.  Tap “Done”.  Select the new “(app name) Icon Flick Up” action that you just created.  Select the app you want to open when you swipe up on the first app’s icon.Possibilities:   Swipe up on Camera to activate Photos  Swipe up on Facebook to open Facebook Messenger  Swipe up on Safari to open Chrome  Swipe up on Music to open Pandora  4. Headphone Menu    Usually when you plug in your headphones you intend to use them right away. Wouldn’t it be convenient to be presented with a list of audio sources since you were going to have to find them anyway? This action takes advantage of Activator’s menu feature to create a menu of the apps you use for audio for quick and easy access when you use your headphones. Instructions:   Select “Menus”.  Select “Add New Menu” and name your menu.  Select your newly created menu.  Select “Add Action” and select an app you want in your menu.  Repeat step 4 until you have all the apps you want in your menu.  Go back to Activator’s main screen and select “Anywhere”.  In the “Wired Headset” section (at the very bottom) select “Connected”.  Select your menu in the “Menus” dropdown.5. Home Button Flashlight Sometimes you need to whip out a flashlight quickly and you don’t want to fiddle with the Control Center to turn on your phone’s flash. This action will let you double tap your home button from the lock screen and brighten up your surroundings in a jiffy. Instructions:   Select “At Lock Screen”.  Select “Double Press”.  Select “Flashlight”.That one was easy! ","categories": ["iOS","Jailbreak"],

        "title": "Skiplagged &#8211; Understanding the Ethics behind &#8220;Hidden City&#8221; Ticketing",
        "excerpt":"It has been awhile since I’ve written an article, but I’ve found the chatter surrounding “hidden city ticketing,” an approach to obtaining cheaper air tickets to be a worthwhile discussion. Orbitz and United Airlines have recently entered a lawsuit against Aktarer Zaman, the twenty-two year old founder of Skiplagged, a website that helps users find cheap tickets by exploiting a method called “hidden city ticketing.” Zaman earlier this year launched a fundraiser to help him cover lawyer fees and has since gained widespread crowd support. Now, the legality of “hidden city ticketing” is a complex dilemma and the ruling on this case could redefine how airlines utilize the hub-and-spoke system. What is Hidden City Ticketing? Let’s say you want to fly from San Diego to Cleveland on ByteRevel Airways. It may not be a highly trafficked route, so a direct flight from San Diego to Cleveland may be somewhat expensive. But ByteRevel Airways offers a flight from San Diego to New York, a popular route, that happens to have a layover in Cleveland. The SD-NY route costs half of what the SD-Cleveland ticket costs, so you reason that you could just buy a ticket for SD-NY but leave the route after your plane lands in Cleveland. You pay as if you were traveling to New York, but you leave the plan just before the last leg of the journey. This type of flight arrangement is known as “hidden city” ticketing, where your real destination is in the middle of the flight route you purchased a ticket for and you don’t complete the entire journey. What is the problem with Hidden City Ticketing? At first glance, this scheme seems to be a greater hassle for those buying tickets and reneging on the entire journey. You can’t check in bags, or they will end up at your flight’s destination. It’s hard to make the journey a roundtrip, because if an airline notices that you didn’t complete the flight, it’s likely they will cancel your ticket. Similarly, airlines can dock you miles if it is determined that you didn’t complete your flight’s full journey. But why do airlines hate this scheme so much? They still get money from your ticket; it seems as if they are losing an opportunity to make even more money if they could’ve sold your ticket ahead of time. HCT causes a few issues for airlines. It disrupts an airline’s logistics especially if many passengers are not boarding flights they paid for.   If a sizeable number of people aren’t boarding a plane, the plane could be delayed.  Airlines overbook planes (another questionable practice, but it technically helps keep airfares low even if it messes up a flight queue) and they determine how much to overbook a plane by the historical numbers of people who don’t show up to the flight (a dubious statistical method that has more sociological implications than economic).  An airline could’ve booked that seat but because of the fact someone bought a ticket, they are required to honor that purchase (although they may try to bump you if their overbooking algorithms fail). This last reason also has another economic implication. The airlines are losing a chance to make more money by booking a San Diego-New York route instead of a San Diego-Cleveland and Cleveland-New York route.Ethical Questions So what do you think? Do you think airlines deserve to have these “arbitrage-esque” situations exploited as they already charge overinflated prices for airline travel? Or do you think Hidden City Ticketing will produce more damage to consumers than the airlines, especially if many buyers use this method to quickly traverse short distances?

        "title": "Computer Science at Undergraduate Level (Part I)",
        "excerpt":"Computer Science is rapidly becoming a popular major among students as the job market for CS majors shows consistent growth. Additionally, the market for CS majors shows Wall Street-esque behavior, as CS majors are generally given large signing bonuses and moving between tech firms has a very up-and-out feel to it. Yet, I believe that studying CS with the intention of making lots of money can lead to foreseeable discontentment. If your heart isn’t in CS, given the sharp learning curve, necessity to train oneself constantly in order to stay relevant, and the inherent meritocracy of the technology industry, you will find yourself in a career that quickly drains any entrepreneurial motivation to succeed in this industry. In these articles, I hope to give guidance on both how to quickly decide if you want to study computer science and how to choose a university at which to study this discipline. In further articles, I will go into more depth about specific universities and their CS programs. Should I study computer science? Computer science is an exciting field, and I love the inherently entrepreneurial nature of the discipline. You are constantly forced to reform your ideas, learn new concepts, and integrate STEM across all of the sciences. Every few weeks, the community develops new tools, ideas, algorithms, software, etc… which keeps the field constantly fresh. The only other industry with this type of innovation is finance, and currently, finance and computer science are growing symbiotically which makes this a very exciting time to study both fields. Now, here is a list of questions you should ask yourself if you are considering a career in CS. These questions are ordered in increasing abstraction:   Do I genuinely enjoy using computers, machines, and technology? Am I interested in how they work, how they can be improved, and how we can use computers best, or do I prefer to just use computers as tools to reach an end?  Do I enjoy few or more of the following subjects: logic, mathematics, economics, physics, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology?  Am I interested in creating, developing, and innovating? Do I have a desire to improve? Am I motivated by problem-solving?  Do I learn for the sake of learning? Do I enjoy learning new things, and do I view education as a lifelong endeavor?  Am I interested in what it means to know, to process, to understand, to interpret, to convey, and to learn? Am I interested in the fundamental underpinnings of thinking and knowledge?Granted, there are many other ways to determine if CS is for you, but from a very philosophical standpoint, these are important questions to ask yourself about the field of computing. Where should I study computer science? Assuming you have decided that computer science is the career for you, where should you study computer science as an undergraduate? This is a difficult question which would require much more introspection, and in later articles I will give more concrete overviews of CS at specific universities, but for now, consider this idea: because CS is meritocratic, meaning you are constantly having to prove yourself as both an innovator, learner, and collaborator in order to keep a job in this industry, the prestige, selectivity, and curriculum of a college matters very little; rather, the character, drive, discipline, and intellect of the individual defines the quality of his or her career. It’s true, certain schools attract more recruiters from bigger name jobs, but the fact of the matter is that entering the technology industry depends little on prestige (for example, Wall Street maintains exclusivity by recruiting at only a handful of universities) but rather on what one can prove. This aspect makes CS both an exciting and competitive industry. When choosing an undergraduate college for computer science, I believe there are three factors to consider:   Am I interested in working closely with professors or do I prefer large lecture based environments?  Am I interested in a particular professor’s or department’s CS research projects?  Would I be challenged and motivated to continue learning throughout my life?The last one is a little tricky and much more subjective, but it is nonetheless crucial to choosing a path for undergraduate study. Some sugegstions I have for determining #3 include reviewing the major requirements, emailing or calling professors, and looking through the department’s mission statement. Conclusion This overview is not meant to provide an all-encompassing determination of whether or not CS is for you, but I do hope it helps with understanding what it means to study computer science. In Part II, I will talk about specific undergraduate programs and what these colleges offer in the way of teaching undergraduates computer science. ","categories": ["Education"],

        "excerpt":"Algorithmic trading is growing field in finance that uses computers to execute securities trades. With growing research in artificial intelligence and machine learning, a computer’s ability to interact with markets and other human phenomena has rapidly increased. The financial sector is becoming increasingly reliant on computers for finding transactions, making markets, and executing trades, and at the heart of algorithmic trading are simply computers following their programming to make buy/sell orders for certain securities. For awhile though, algorithmic trading was a field pertaining only to experienced data scientists, programmers, and mathematicians that worked on Wall Street banks and Chicago prop shops. Yet, with the development of tools such as Quantopian and QuantConnect, any trader can connect his or her brokerage account to an algorithmic platform and execute computerized transactions. Quantopian Quantopian is a fascinating company founded in Boston under the mission of “bringing Wall Street to main street.” Beneath its bright red exterior on the homepage is a service that offers testing grounds for trading algorithms, algorithm design competitions, full-fledged brokerage connection services to trade real money, and a crowd-sourced hedge fund. The last feature, a crowd-sourced hedge fund, is a curious dynamic offered by Quantopian. Quantopian holds competitions between its users to write stock trading algorithms. Whoever has the most successful algorithms is then invited to manage $100,000 of Quantopian funds and keep all of the profits made on that money. Given that it’s free to register for Quantopian, anyone interested in having their stock market strategies see large-scale use (or at least, larger than individual investing) should learn the Quantopian trading API  (which is in Python) and compete in their monthly contests.           Sample Code provided by Quantopian   In all, I highly recommend investigating Quantopian’s services if you are interested in learning how algorithmic trading works or testing your own strategies.

        "title": "The Growth of Sharing Services",
        "excerpt":"Over the past few years, the tech sector has seen an emergence of, for lack of a better term, “sharing services,” or companies that network and rent out distributed capital. In simpler terms, these are start-ups that don’t own the capital that provides a service (e.g. a car for a taxi service company) but rather connect people who are willing to “rent” out their capital to people who would rather “rent” than purchase capital outright. Consider Über, Breather, or airbnb. These businesses don’t own cars, office spaces, or vacation homes. Rather, they are built on existing infrastructure. Their businesses rely on matching unused capital (such as cars / drivers, office buildings / meeting spaces, home space) with people in need of services. By exploiting unused capital instead of purchasing new capital outright, these businesses are able to lower their own costs thus making “rentals” much cheaper. In all, these “sharing services” are making capital use more efficient as the owners of capital are not losing as much money as they could by leaving their cars, office spaces, rooms unused (in terms of economic profit) and consumers benefit tremendously from lower prices. The middlemen, Über, Breather, or airbnb, collect a small fee for providing the network as well. It’s a win-win-win. When I worked for Quadral Apps LLC, a software consulting company that I co-founded, one of our clients was Next Image Medical (now they’ve been absorbed by Canterbury Healthcare). Next Image Medical was in the “sharing services” business but with a very specific form of capital: MRI machines. When MRI machines were unused, they would contact Next Image Medical who would in turn schedule MRI appointments for patients. Since the machines would otherwise be unused, the MRIs were discounted and Next Image would collect a small premium on each appointment scheduled. This type of “capital sharing” business model is similar to that of the aforementioned companies. Essentially, these “sharing services” are using technology to make markets or make existing markets more efficient. The growth of technology over the past few years has allowed these types of “capital sharing” networks to emerge dramatically. As a note to all entrepreneurs pondering new startup ideas, I’d suggest looking into developing new “capital sharing” networks; look for unused capital that can be rented out in some capacity and build a network around connecting them to consumers looking to borrow rather than own. An aside – I realized that I’m coining a lot of terms in this article, some of which may not be completely accurate; I hope they convey the ideas nonetheless   ","categories": ["Entrepreneurship","Rant"],

        "excerpt":" Have you ever tried to pause your music with your native media keys only to accidentally start up iTunes and have multiple songs playing at once? Have you ever had the absurd notion that pressing the “skip” button should play the next video in a YouTube playlist? You aren’t alone. Providing this intuitive functionality has been the goal of open source project BeardedSpice since late 2013, and the list of services it supports is huge! It even supports now defunct websites like GrooveShark (yikes, if a contributor is reading this, please removing this!). BeardedSpice lives in your menu bar. It will attempt to control the currently focused tab or application, but you can also select the service you want to control from its dropdown menu. It would seem that the ability to pause any media playing should be native functionality for all Macs, but implementing specific javascript hooks for controlling web applications is delicate and messy at the best of times. BeardedSpice works by applying scripts developed by the community to supported websites that interact with their javascript controls, so support can indeed break at any time, and adding support for websites is time consuming. To maintain consistency, the utility also supports popular native media players like Spotify and VLC.  If you don’t use a keyboard with media keys, fear not. BeardedSpice is highly configurable and allows you to bind any keys to ‘previous’, ‘pause/play’, and ‘next’ actions. Be sure to set it to launch on login! This is a great opportunity to make contributions to an open source project that will be noticed and appreciated. If a website you use isn’t yet supported, consider having a go at it and submitting your plugin to the project. There are also a few open issues with websites that people already want support for.
