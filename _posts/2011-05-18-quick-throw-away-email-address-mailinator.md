We&#8217;ve all been there, you visit a website that requires you to sign up with a valid email address and you don&#8217;t want to give them your real one, or maybe you are just sick of setting up email accounts and want a temporary receive-only one. In some cases, [BugMeNot](/2011/05/09/bugmenot-surpass-compulsory-registration-websites/ "BugMeNot – Bypass Compulsory Registration Websites") might do the trick for quick and easy access to a website, but sometimes you would rather just sign up with a throw-away email address. Mailinator.com recognizes this dilemma and has a solution.

Mailinator allows users to receive emails sent to any @mailinator.com email address. All you have to do is sign up for a website or share your mailinator email address and all mail sent to that address can be found at youraddress.mailinator.com where &#8221; youraddress&#8221; is the username part of the email address.

The obvious con is that all mail will be public. While this is so, you can make it near private by choosing a very original username and taking advantage of Mailinator&#8217;s  <a title="http://mailinator.blogspot.com/2008/03/introducing-alternate-inbox-names.html" href="http://mailinator.blogspot.com/2008/03/introducing-alternate-inbox-names.html" target="_blank">alternate inbox names</a>. The alternate inbox name of any address can be found right above the inbox of that address. It looks something like &#8220;Alternate Address for this Inbox:  <span style="color: red;">M8R-0rnf9k</span>@mailinator.com&#8221;. If you give this email out instead of the direct address, only you will know the username of the inbox.

Another cool feature of Mailinator is <a title="http://www.mailinator.com/widgetmaker.jsp" href="http://www.mailinator.com/widgetmaker.jsp" target="_blank">the widget maker</a>. This allows you to make a useful widget that you can embed into any website or into your <a title="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?type=gadgets&url=www.gavitron.com/mailn8.xml" href="http://www.google.com/ig/directory?type=gadgets&url=www.gavitron.com/mailn8.xml" target="_blank">iGoogle homepage</a>.
