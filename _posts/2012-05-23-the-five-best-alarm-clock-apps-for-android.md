Smartphones are great for many things, and one great use of your smartphone is as an alarm clock. Smartphones make great alarm clocks because they are always with you, and have all kinds of hardware features that allow them to be especially good at waking you up. This article covers the five best alarm clock apps for Android phones.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"></strong>

**Alarm Clock Plus**
  
This app has a great interface, and it includes a home shortcut, a photo slideshow feature, countdown timers, and a handy snooze feature. The snooze feature requires you to solve a math problem before it will silence the alarm. This is great because your option is to wake up enough to solve the problem, which by then you are mostly awake anyway, or tear the battery out of the phone, which is a pretty extreme solution. There is also a free ad supported version.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"></strong>

**AlarmDroid**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong></strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3591" title="clock-alarmdroid" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid.jpeg" alt="" width="502" height="412" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid.jpeg 620w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid-300x246.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid-180x147.jpeg 180w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/05/clock-alarmdroid-360x295.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></a><br /> This alarm app is one of the better ones available for Android. It is simple and feature packed. It has a talking alarm clock feature that informs you of the weather and the time as an alarm. It also has a robust scheduling system. The app comes with a widget that counts down your next alarm. There is a free version and a paid version.<br /> <strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"><br /> I Can’t Wake Up<br /> </strong>This is a great alarm clock app as well. While this app also features math problem alarm dismissal, you can also choose number ordering, memory tests, repeated patterns, and a bar code. These are sure to get you up and thinking if you want to get your alarm to switch off. You can even set more than one of these Wake Up Methods, as they call them. All of this and the app is free.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"></strong>

**Alarm Clock Xtreme**
  
This alarm has all of the features you would expect in an alarm clock app. What is unique about this app is that it adds Captcha, shake, and docking as methods of silencing the alarm. This just adds a few more options for alarm dismissal. The app also features an alarm that gradually gets louder to gently wake you, as well as a home screen widget.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"></strong>

**ElectricSleep**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong></strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/electric-sleep.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3593" title="electric-sleep" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/electric-sleep.jpeg" alt="" width="287" height="511" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/electric-sleep.jpeg 359w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/05/electric-sleep-168x300.jpeg 168w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/05/electric-sleep-180x320.jpeg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 287px) 100vw, 287px" /></a><br /> This app is a bit different from the others. The idea behind this app is that it uses the accelerometer in your phone to sense you movements and determine where you are in your sleep cycle. The idea is that the alarm will wake you when you are in one of the lighter stages of sleep, leaving you feeling more rested. Of course this means that you have to sleep with your phone next to your body. It is an interesting concept to say the least.<strong id="internal-source-marker_0.12431547371670604"></strong>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So if you haven’t considered using your Android phone as your primary alarm clock before, you may want to consider it as these feature packed apps offer functionality that a bedside clock could only dream of doing. You can even try many of these apps for free, so what are you waiting for?
