On August 26th of 2010, a man by the name of Tony Gines had a bright idea. This idea was simple, yet not implemented on any other website. This idea was &#8220;Unhearit&#8221;. What &#8220;Unhearit&#8221; does is &#8220;help you get that damn song out of your head&#8221; by playing another that replaces it. He probably didn&#8217;t expect much out of his website, and was shocked to find that Unhear.it got over 2,000,000 hits in a mere two months!

I was one of those 2 million. I was fortunate enough to be able to watch Unhearit slowly develop from a shaky launch to a viral service. Back when it was new, it played a smaller selection of songs (some of which are now removed due to copyright issues), and its domain was Unhear.it. Now, Unhearit boasts an uncountable number of songs, has released a <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unhearit/id394588168" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/unhearit/id394588168" target="_blank">mobile app for iOS</a>, and has changed its domain from Unhear.it to Unhearit.com.

Another surprising characteristic of Unhearit is that the entire website consists of only one page. That&#8217;s ONE single page, and already Unhearit.com has reached the rank of 521,417 on Alexa. Wow.
