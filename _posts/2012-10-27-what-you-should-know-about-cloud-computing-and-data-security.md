When setting up a new computing system for your home or office, you might decide to start employing some cloud computing techniques. As with any computer system or program, you need to be on the lookout for security issues. Plenty of Internet hackers and dubious characters are looking for any possible ways to obtain your personal information.

  <strong>Bringing in Outsiders</strong><br /> According to the article entitled &#8220;Three Cloud-Computing Data Security Risks That Can&#8217;t Be Overlooked&#8221; by Slavik Markovich, one of the biggest dangers out there comes from the fact that outsourced individuals now have access to the information of many companies. They are essentially able to go around standard home security features and be welcomed right into all of your company&#8217;s information!</p> 
  
  <p>
    <strong>Changing Servers</strong><br /> This Cloud Security Alliance Article (CSA) goes on to explain that the location of the information also fluctuates. At any given moment, it&#8217;s difficult to know where all of the company&#8217;s information is. When you&#8217;re unaware of a location, you are also opening yourself up to possible attacks. Furthermore, it&#8217;s likely that you have some sort of security or monitoring devices implemented on your business based program. However, when data is constantly moving around, it can be extremely difficult to keep track of everything. You might wind up creating an even bigger nightmare and monster for you and your company.

    <strong>Ability to Control</strong><br /> Not only is some of the information essentially set off to unknown areas when you use a cloud computing system, you are actually sometimes limited in the amount of control you can assert. According to Network Computing&#8217;s article &#8220;Cloud Enthusiasts Worry About Data Security&#8221; by Robert Mullins, &#8220;When asked about their ability to monitor their cloud service, only 20 [percent] saw an improvement while 22 [percent] reported a decline, and most reported no change.&#8221; Clearly, this does not happen in the majority of cases. However, you need to be aware that there is at least a chance of losing a decent portion of control.<br /> <strong><br /> Resolving the Issues</strong><br /> Ultimately, when you choose to implement a cloud computing system for your business or company, you&#8217;re just going to have to deal with some of the effects. All systems have their own flaws that have to be accepted by the users. However, you can be certain to keep track of data as much as possible, and be aware of what you put out there into cyberspace. Additionally, you should consider hiring a computer and web security professional to be a part of the team. When something is wrong or you have a concern, a member of your staff will be able to offer expert advice and solutions.</div> 
    
    <div>
      Don&#8217;t be terrified of cloud computing, as a system like this can certainly offer a lot of value and ease for your company. However, as with most computer systems, you need to be aware of the potential issues that could arise. Do your best to always stay at least one step ahead of the cloud computing game!
