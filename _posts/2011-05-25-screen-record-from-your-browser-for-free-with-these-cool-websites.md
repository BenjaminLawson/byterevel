In the past, if you wanted to make a screencast you would have to buy expensive screen recording software or download a free alternative (that probably didn&#8217;t meet up to expectations). Nowadays, you can take advantage of extremely convenient online screen recording web services. In the rest of this post I will be reviewing some of the impressive websites that offer such services. All of these require the latest version of Java as they run by means of Java applets.

Here they are, listed in order from my favorite to my least favorite.
