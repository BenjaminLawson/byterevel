  <strong>RobotC is a language that one would use to program a Lego Mindstorms Robot. The kits are a bit pricey, but they offer an amazing amount of possibilitiesâ€“from a simple bot that moves and turns or one that can flush your toilet or tear off toilet paper strips, to more complex designs that could potentially solve a Rubik&#8217;s Cube if one knew how to program it. That is what I&#8217;ll be showing you.</strong>

**Starting Off**

RobotC is a programming language geared towards robotics. It is primarily used with Lego Mindstorms. It is available for download at <http://www.robotc.net/download/nxt/> (there is a 30 day free trial ). RobotC is only available for Windows, but it can be run on a mac with Windows virtualization /emulation software.

You will also need a <a title="http://mindstorms.lego.com/" href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/" target="_blank">Lego Mindstorms kit</a>. I recommend that you build the standard model if you&#8217;re new to this, because it&#8217;s easy to build and it will work just fine.

Once you&#8217;ve downloaded RobotC on Windows, go to _Programs>Robotics Academy>RobotC for MINDSTORMS Building License>RobotC for MINDSTORMS_

 **Running Your First Program**

Once your robot is built, you need to plug it into your computer via the USB cable that comes with your robot. Open RobotC and go to Robot>Download Firmware to download the firmware onnto the NXT device.

To start I would recommend downloading a sample program onto your NXT. Go to File>Open Sample Program and open Training Samples to MotorC Forward. Open it and go to Robot>Compile and Download Program to load it onto your NXT. To run it, on the NXT menu, go to My Files>SoftwareFiles>MotorC Forward>Run.

**That is all for now, in the next tutorial we will be programming the robot yourself and making it do what you want.**
