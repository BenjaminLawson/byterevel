There many fascinating websites on the web that are worth mentioning but don&#8217;t quite make it to a full post. Here&#8217;s a roundup of 5 websites I&#8217;ve found that you should check out. They may change your life.

**5. Pakin &#8211; The Complaint Generator**

You can complain about anyone, without the painful writing part. All you have to do is enter the person&#8217;s full name & title and select the amount of paragraphs you want, and let the program do the rest. The program then pulls up an entire article complaining about the person (or company) you specified.

There also is an iPhone app called iComplain.

**4. Snopes**

This is a very nice website. It discusses rumors and myths in a forum-style deduction. But the layout is clean enough to find what you are looking for without all the strange layouts of a forum.

**3. Let Me Google That For You** 

If you have relatives or friends who ask extremely obvious questions and you want to humor them further, or they are too lazy to look stuff up themselves, Let Me Google That For You is the great solution to this peculiar predicament. The website is pretty self-explanatory, but what you do is enter what someone asked you, then it creates an animation of how to google it. Then you give the link ro the animation to whomever asked you, and they&#8217;ll not thank you.

**2. Zork &#8211; Be Eaten By Grues All Day Long!**

For those of you who have never played the game Zork, you&#8217;re missing out on a lot of the 70s. Zork is a text based video game that kind of made it popular. I can&#8217;t give too much of it away, but you should check it out. This website hopes to bring back the Zork experience by converting it to an online version readable by most web browsers. You can even create an account and save your progress.

**1. Cleverbot &#8211; Talk to yourself without looking Schizophrenic** 

This program lets you argue with yourself all day long. Just enter whatever the heck you want and it&#8217;ll come up with some smart@$$ answer to it. As human as it may seem, it is not a human at all. When I used it, it convinced me I was a robot. I believed it. Then I remembered I&#8217;m not a robot&#8230;.That&#8217;s another story.
