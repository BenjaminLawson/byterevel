**What is Java?**

So JAVA is one of the [most prolific](/2011/06/29/top-10-programming-languages-based-on-prolific-usage/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+byterevelblog+%28Byte+Revel%29) programming languages out there, and is used by 6.5 million programmers on more than 1.1 billion desktops.
