  Valve, the game company behind hugely popular games like Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, and Half-Life, is making it&#8217;s steller game Portal free until the 20th of September. Released back in 2007, Portal gameplay consists of solving complex physics puzzles with the use of a single gun. The gun is no ordinary one, it doesn&#8217;t shoot bullets. Instead, it shoots portals onto various surfaces. Only two portals can be in existence  at the same time, making it all the more difficult. Any gamer will tell you that this game is a must play, even at its original price of $20.

  As for storyline, you are an older Asian woman that is essentially a lab subject at Aperture Labs. A computerized voice acts as your guide and instructor, leading you through two+ solid hours of gameplay.
