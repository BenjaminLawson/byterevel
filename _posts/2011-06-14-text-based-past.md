Whatever happened to text-based games? It seems that as our gaming consoles become more and more powerful we are more apt to forget gaming&#8217;s past. However, even as we strive to beat out our friend&#8217;s graphics card, it is still nice to take a trip back to the humble beginnings of games. Although most end-users won’t like the thought of the graphics-free gaming experience of a fictional world, they may be, much like I was, surprised at how much fun they can have while playing one of these classic games.  Even though most people would look at the lack of pictures and maps as a loss, once they get deep into a game, one can find that having a picture of the world solely in your mind allows a person to closely scrutinize the environment that a console-based graphics-fueled game would never allow you to do.  If this post has made you curious to experience the classic gaming magic that is a text-based adventure, there are many ways to enjoy a game across a number of platforms.  Now, if you download an interpreter and are afraid that you may come across a shortage of games, fear not because there is an entire database of free (and paid) games.  This website is here, at the [IFDB](http://ifdb.tads.org/) (Interactive Fiction Database).  Happy Typing!
