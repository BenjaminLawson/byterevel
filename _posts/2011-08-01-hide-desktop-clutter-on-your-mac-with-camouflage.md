I&#8217;m an unorganized slob. My desktop is littered with over 200 folders, images, files, and applications. Just as I was about to lose all hope towards having a desktop that at least appeared clean, I bumped into Camouflage.

Camouflage is a small, effective, and quick Mac application that lets you easily hide all of the icons on your desktop. It&#8217;s small control button resides in your toolbar, and all you need to do to hide the clutter on your desktop is click the button and select &#8220;Hide Icons&#8221;.

Some great customizable aspects include setting a custom wallpaper to appear when hiding icons, and setting a folder that you want to open when you double-click the icon-free desktop. By default, the camouflage wallpaper is your normal wallpaper, and the Desktop folder will open when you double-click the clean desktop. To navigate to these preferences, you need only to click the toolbar icon and select &#8220;Preferences&#8230;&#8221;.

If you find yourself using Camouflage frequently, you can set a hot key for easy on-off toggling.

You can download this nifty utility from the <a title="http://www.briksoftware.com/products/camouflage/index_camouflage1.php" href="http://www.briksoftware.com/products/camouflage/index_camouflage1.php" target="_blank">developer&#8217;s website for free</a>, or from the <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id445264274" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id445264274" target="_blank">Mac App Store for $1.99</a>. The free version is actually the older version, but it runs fine on Mac OS 10.4 &#8211; 10.6. Although it runs on Lion, it will render Mission Control unusable while Camouflage is running. The new paid version fixes this issue (and you will be supporting a hard working developer).
