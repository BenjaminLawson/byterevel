This review is on Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars for the iPhone and iPod Touch. The gameplay is presented from a bird&#8217;s eye view. It doesn&#8217;t have good graphics and it lags a lot if you have about half of your iPhone with data on it. The game does have a really good story line, though, and if they just put a little more time into the glitches, and made it look more real compared to just a bunch of pictures, it would be a lot better. There is one part in the game when you go to do Lester&#8217;s first challenge on the motorcycle. As soon as you get to the right spot, the buttons freeze up and stop working. I have tried it about 7 times and each time it freezes. It does have a good open world platform but it still needs some work (like I said before). If I could make one small change I would make it so there were more layers. I say that as it should to have more depth in the objects and you should be able to walk into the buildings and talk to the people on the street (not just kill them).

Overall- \***

Graphics- *

Story- \****

Fighting- \***

The going price is $9.99, and you can grab it <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/app/grand-theft-auto-chinatown/id344186162" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/grand-theft-auto-chinatown/id344186162" target="_blank">here</a>.
