If you’re anything like me, you probably have something to say about the battery life on your Android device. My Nexus battery drains power at an unbelievable rate. If it were up to me, I would be able to surf the web looking at pictures of cute cats and toggle back and forth between Words With Friends and Flood-It all day.  However, if you’re looking to improve your battery life, there are a few great apps you should check out. None of these apps will make your battery stronger, but they will sure help your phone go further on a single charge.

## Green Power

_Price- free_

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3396" title="green_power_premium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="319" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium.jpeg 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium-300x159.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium-180x95.jpeg 180w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium-360x191.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/green_power_premium.jpeg)

If you’ve ever been concerned about how valiantly your device tries to access a Wi-Fi network that just doesn’t exist, Green Power is the app for you. You can configure how long your device tries to access Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data before giving up (a really helpful tool for devices that swear they’re picking up a network signal that just won’t allow them to connect for some reason). It is also fully automatic which means that once you’ve configured it, you don’t have to keep activating the app. You can just sit back and enjoy longer battery life.

## Juice Defender

_Price- free-$4.99_

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3398" title="JuiceDefender" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="455" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender.jpeg 550w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender-300x248.jpeg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender-180x148.jpeg 180w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender-360x297.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/JuiceDefender.jpeg)

Juice Defender operates similarly to Green Power, managing your Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mobile data. It’s the upgrade, UltimateJuice, which is really worth mentioning. If you use an app like Pandora or Stitcher that relies on streaming, you can adjust the settings with UltimateJuice to allow certain apps to access Wi-Fi uninterrupted.

## Battery Indicator Pro

_Price-$2.49_

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3399" title="battery-indicator-pro" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/battery-indicator-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="307" height="512" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/battery-indicator-pro.jpeg 307w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/battery-indicator-pro-179x300.jpeg 179w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/02/battery-indicator-pro-180x300.jpeg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" />](/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/battery-indicator-pro.jpeg)

Battery Indicator Pro does not possess actual power saving features but it does a great job of telling you how your battery life is being spent. The Pro version, an upgrade from the free standard version, also includes a file where your phone can log your battery activity, noting spikes in usage and documenting which apps take up the most juice. The app also includes a percentage in the status bar at the top of your device’s home screen that indicates the exact amount of battery you have left.

You might not be able to do all your favorite mobile device activities without occasionally returning to a power outlet, but these apps will cut down on the amount of time your phone has to stay tethered to the wall.
