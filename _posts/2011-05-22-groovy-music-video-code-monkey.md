<a title="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/primer/" href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/primer/" target="_blank">Jonathan Coulton</a> is &#8220;a musician, a singer-songwriter and an internet superstar&#8221; who, back in September of 2005, decided to start a &#8220;thing a week&#8221; campaign. This campaign consisted of him recording a new song every week and releasing it for free on his website. One such song that is believed by many to be the best of the campaign is &#8220;Code Monkey&#8221;. Inspired by a job he once had writing software, the song details the life of a monkey who works for a company that appears to do business relating to web development.

A man by name of Mike Spiff Booth (<a title="http://spiffworld.com/" href="http://spiffworld.com/" target="_blank">his website</a>) decided that he would make music videos for some of Jonathan Coulton&#8217;s songs. You probably can see where this is going. He made a video to go along with Jonathan&#8217;s song &#8220;Code Monkey&#8221;. The videos that Mike makes consist of a mix of World of Warcraft graphics and some video editing. Anyways, here&#8217;s the music video that Mike made for Jonathan&#8217;s &#8220;Code Monkey&#8221;.
