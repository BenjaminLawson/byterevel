I&#8217;m not old enough to pull a &#8220;Back in my day&#8221; ramble but I can say that ScummVM allows you old timers and adventurous new generation people to play games that the old timers used to adore as much as you new generation people do towards Minecraft. Now that I just blew your mind, let me explain what ScummVM is.

ScummVM stands for Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion Virtual Machine. What is it? It is an open source engine that allows you to play (old) games made with the SCUMM scripting language. You can download these games off of  their website or on many other websites that host archives of old DOS SCUMM games, such as <a title="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/gamegroup/scumm/" href="http://www.dosgamesarchive.com/gamegroup/scumm/" target="_blank">dosgamesarchive.com</a>.  I assure you, you will be able to find **many** great, free Point-and-Click games on those sites (including such titles as _Beneath a Steel Sky_ and _Flight of the Amazon Queen_).

<a href="http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link for the ScummVM website and [here](http://www.scummvm.org/downloads/) is the link for the downloads page.
