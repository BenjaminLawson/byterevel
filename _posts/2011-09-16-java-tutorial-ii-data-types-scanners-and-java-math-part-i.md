Understanding Data Types is a necessity to be learned whenever learning a programming language. As stated in [this](/2011/07/10/objective-c-tutorial-2-variables-and-data-types/)Â tutorial, there are 6 major data types. But we&#8217;ll cover only 4 of them; Double, Float, Int, and Char. Id, Boolean and String are somewhat higher concepts, so we&#8217;ll work with them later on.

So, without further ado, let&#8217;s dive into creating data types! We&#8217;ll start with Integers. Along the way, we&#8217;ll cover important code such as Input/Output, displaying integers and floats, and mathematics!
