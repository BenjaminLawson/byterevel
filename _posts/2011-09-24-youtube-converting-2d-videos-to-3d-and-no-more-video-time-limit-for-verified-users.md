YouTube has recently started rolling out a Beta version of their 2D to 3D conversion program that, well, converts your 2D videos to 3D videos. They were led to do this by the great popularity of 3D televisions and related gear in the past year. Being the leading internet video publishing platform, they felt that it was their duty to bring modern video technology to the world wide web. Also, they realized that only a tiny portion of the population possessed dual lens cameras capable of capturing 3D footage. A couple of YouTube developers have been fiddling around with supporting 3D video for years, but few people made use of their projects.

There must be some pretty intense algorithms behind this process! Apparently, their conversion tool evaluates the color and motion of a video in order to simulate a 3D video. Oh, and in case the picture I included above didn&#8217;t tip you off, you will still need to wear those dorky red-blue glasses to see the third dimension of converted videos.

As if that amazing feature weren&#8217;t cool enough, all verified  YouTube users can now upload videos longer than 15 minutes. By verified, I mean users who have shared their phone number with Google and received a text message containing a secret code. Also, users must not have an account with videos that have been flagged and taken down. Prior to this announcement, users had to either be a YouTube partner or have a popular channel to upload videos longer than 15 minutes.
