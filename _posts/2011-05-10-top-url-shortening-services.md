URL shortening services have been around for many years. They make life simpler by taking long URLs and making a shortened version. This shortened version is basically a page on the shortening service&#8217;s website that forwards to the desired URL. The many uses/benefits of URL shortening services include:

  * making the most out of character limits in messaging services such as Twitter
  * quick and easy fix for email clients or other programs that chop off part of a URL due to a line break
  * it&#8217;s pleasant to see a short URL as opposed to a long one
  * keeping track of the click statistics of a link
  * hiding affiliate links

For instance, say I want to tweet a link to that [awesome article on Byte Revel about Grooveshark](/2011/05/03/grooveshark-listen-to-millions-of-songs-for-free/ "Grooveshark â€“ Listen to Millions of Songs For Free"). The normal URL is /2011/05/03/grooveshark-listen-to-millions-of-songs-for-free/. There&#8217;s no way we want to use up our precious character count with that! So, we head over to URL shortening service <a title="http://is.gd" href="http://is.gd" target="_blank">is.gd</a> and paste /2011/05/03/grooveshark-listen-to-millions-of-songs-for-free/ into the &#8220;shorten!&#8221; bar. Is.gd gives me a nice short link- [http://is.gd/EBnKBn](http://is.gd/EBnKBn "http://is.gd/EBnKBn").

One of the few disadvantages of shortened URLs is that they can be used to hide links to malicious websites. Be sure that you trust the author of a shortened link before clicking on it. Of course, this is true with all links, not just shortened ones.

Anyhow, let&#8217;s cut to the chase. Here&#8217;s a list of some of the best URL shortening services out there!
