I bumped into this nifty gadget while looking for some iPod accessories. The Belkin Rockstar lets you easily split the audio out from an iPod, MP3 player, DVD player, or other portable media device. What makes this splitter unique is that up to 5 different headphones can connect to it (customary audio splitters only split two ways). Not only that, but you can connect multiple audio outputting devices at once. Of course, if you play audio from multiple devices at the same time, the audio will be blended.

I don&#8217;t think that there has ever been a time when I&#8217;ve wanted to share my iPod audio with five of my friends, but if that sounds like something you would do, this is probably for you. I can see this being useful if you have a portable DVD player and you are on a long car ride with multiple people, or if you have several speakers you wan to connect your iPod to. Of course, it will probably be useless in these scenarios if you don&#8217;t have a couple headphones handy.

The going price is $14.99 if you buy it from <a title="http://www.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=404634" href="http://www.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=404634" target="_blank">their website</a>, but you can also <a title="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-RockStar-3-5-mm-Headphone-Splitter/dp/B0017PG8KS" href="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-RockStar-3-5-mm-Headphone-Splitter/dp/B0017PG8KS" target="_blank">buy it from Amazon</a> for $27.95 (new) or $6.59 (used). That&#8217;s not too overly priced, especially when you consider that most two-way splitters go for around $7. This includes the audio splitter itself, one integrated green audio cable, and one detachable cable.
