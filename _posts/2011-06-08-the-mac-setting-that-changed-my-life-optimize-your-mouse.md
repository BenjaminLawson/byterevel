All these years, I&#8217;ve been unaware of a great system preference in the Macintosh OS that allows you to set your mouse to have up to three buttons (left, right, center) and/or set other buttons on the mouse to do a preferred task. What amazed me the most about this is that I could turn a mouse with what I thought had only one button to a mouse with a normal left and right click.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <div id="attachment_928" style="max-width: 544px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
    <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-928 " title="mac-mouse-settings" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings.png" alt="" width="534" height="461" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings.png 668w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings-300x258.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings-180x155.png 180w, /wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mac-mouse-settings-360x310.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px" /></a>

    No longer must I suffer as I reach waaaaay across the keyboard to the &#8220;control&#8221; button and apply intense mental concentration as I try to press it at the same time that I click the left mouse button. In order to experience the same relief that I am enjoying, simply head on over to your local system preferences and click &#8220;Mouse&#8221;. That will bring you to the settings panel as displayed in the picture above. Set the right mouse button to &#8220;Secondary Button&#8221; and you now have a right click enabled mouse! Congratulations, and good luck getting used to it!

    This settings panel is also great for making any other mouse button modifications that you want. I encourage you to experiment with different set-ups and see what works for you!
