Ported iPhone Games is a term for games that were intended for other platforms (such as PC) but translated over to iPhone. Here are some of the most prolific and somewhat most entertaining iPhone Ports.

&nbsp;

**1. The Secret of Monkey Island**

Price: $7.99

Developer: LucasArts

The game that defined Point-and-click games. This game includes humor as well as adventure, with quite entertaining cartoons. I believe every fan of Point-and-Click games should get a copy of this. The only hesitation one would come across, is the steep price tag for such an app. I encourage one to try out the free version, and if they like that, they should definitely get the full version. There is also The Secret of Monkey Island II out, for fans of the original.

**2. The Sims 3**

Price: Varies ($0.99 to $6.99)

Developer: Electronic Arts

_Note:_ Electronic Art ported most of their own games over to iPhone, and could probably fill up an entire list of their own apps, but that would defeat the purpose of creating a varied iPhone Apps list? Right?

This is a very dimmed down version of The Sims 3, but nonetheless contains many of the aspects that the original, PC version had. The iPhone&#8217;s processor cannot withhold that much of a burden that the Original Sims 3 would boast upon it. The iPhone version is interesting, but once you get used to the game, and complete most of the achievements, it becomes dull and monotonous. You soon find yourself marrying everyone in town, due to lack of other options. If you loved The Sims 3, you may enjoy this game, but it probably won&#8217;t stay interesting for more than several weeks (at most).

**3. Dragon&#8217;s Lair**

Price: $0.99 &#8211; $4.99

Developer: Electronic Arts

Yes, I know. I said Electronic Arts already ports games and blah blah blah about having a category for themselves. I never said that they don&#8217;t deserve some spots on the list! Ha! I found a loophole with what I said! Yes! Oh wait. What was I talking about?

Oh yeah! Dragon&#8217;s Lair. I&#8217;m not old enough to pull one of the &#8220;I remember in my day we used to play Dragon&#8217;s Lair and it cost me so many quarters I found meself acting homeless just so I could play one more game,&#8221; but I can say that Dragon&#8217;s Lair is a pretty old game. It happened to be one of the most popular games too. That&#8217;s why it was ported.

**4. Space Invaders**

Price: $4.99

Developer: Taito

Space Invaders. One of the Retro Games, and I am still not old enough to pull off a &#8220;Back in my day&#8230;&#8221; But other than that, Space Invaders still has aspects of one of the old video game machines such as the awful graphics (sorry, no euphemism here) or the fact I just &#8216;put all my money into a machine and can&#8217;t get past level 2.&#8217; But $4.99 (20 quarters for those of you&#8230;You know who you are) for this kind of game may seem great for one of y&#8217;all who played this as a kid, but with so many other options, I believe it seems unnecessary.

**5. Beneath a Steel Sky: Remastered**

Price: $2.99

Developer: Revolution

I like this game. It is similar to The Secret of Monkey Island, but instead of taking place with a joyful theme and pirates that drink grog till they&#8217;re wasted, it takes place in a future dystopia. Those of you who have played the original version will not be disappointed by this gameplay.

**6. Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars**

Price: $6.99 to $9.99

Developer: Rockstar Games

I don&#8217;t like this game that much. The point is to sell drugs, buy guns, shoot Asians, steal cars, and repeat process. But other than my opinion, people seem to enjoy this game often (I guess people like to get their anger out on cartoons). I don&#8217;t have much more to say about this. I only included this so I don&#8217;t get yelled at. A pretty macho thing to do, right?

**7. Monopoly, Scrabble, Catan, Etc.**

Price: Various

Developers: Various (mostly Electronic Arts)

Okay, these aren&#8217;t exactly ports, but say what you will. I believe them to be ports of the original video game; The non-existant one. But other then that, I find two flaws with board games:

1. The computer stacks the game so it is either in favor of you or itself

2. The randomness of the game is not really &#8220;random.&#8221; It is more of a series of probabilities that the programmers had to come up with (you can&#8217;t simulate randomness).

But I am not complaining. The programmers behind it put a lot of effort and are begging to be rewarded.

&nbsp;

**8. Plants vs. Zombies**

Price: $2.99

Developer: PopCap Games

PopCap ported all their games over. Peggle, Chuzzle, and Bejeweled. I just don&#8217;t see the appeal of Bejeweled (well, actually I do&#8230;I just get bored of Bejeweled), Peggle is nice, and Chuzzle is&#8230;interesting. But Plants vs. Zombies is PopCap&#8217;s best game they ported over. If you haven&#8217;t gotten ahold of one, I recommend buying it.

**9. Peggle**

Price: $2.99

Developer: PopCap Games

Someone mention Peggle? I did! Yay! Peggle! Yay! Not much else to say.

**10. Chaos Rings**

Price: $12.99

Developer: Square Enix

Chaos Rings is one of the best RPG/Adventure games ever to hit the App store. I put it in 10th because I am saving the best for last. There are so many great things about the game that I&#8217;d find myself being repeatedly tagged &#8220;Mr. Obvious.&#8221; If you check 1 game out, it should be this one.
