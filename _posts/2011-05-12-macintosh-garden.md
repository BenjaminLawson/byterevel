Fist off, you must either have an old iMac with Mac OS 9 or earlier installed, a PowerPC running Mac OS 10.1 or 10.2 (those initial versions of Mac OS 10 included MAc OS 9 support!), or simply a copy of Mac OS 9 or earlier (if need be, you can try to find one on Macintosh Garden) if you want to make any use of Macintosh Garden. If you are running on a newer machine and have gotten your hands (or cursor) on a copy of a classic version of the Mac OS, head on over to <a title="http://basilisk.cebix.net/" href="http://basilisk.cebix.net/" target="_blank">http://basilisk.cebix.net/</a> or <a title="http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/" href="http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/" target="_blank">http://sheepshaver.cebix.net/</a> for a great Mac emulator!

With that said, Macintosh Garden is the best classic Macintosh abandonware archive website on the web! It boasts 1000+ classic applications, including games, utilities, browsers, and many more apps that fall under other categories. It organizes user uploaded content that has been verified as abandonware, and allows anyone to start downloading classic software after a simple signup.

Why would you want to do this? Well, same reasons as mentioned in [our post about DOSBox](/2011/05/05/dosbox/ "Use DOSBox For Smooth, Clean DOS Emulation!"). That is, to fix those feelings of nostalgia (for those that played games back in the days of Mac Classic), or simply to enjoy playing some of the greatest games ever made. All of this is available for free in the form of abandonware (as mentioned above). For those unfamiliar with the term, abandonware is software that was abandoned by its author and released for free (usually due to the loss of popularity of a software platform). Also, as said on the Macintosh Garden website, &#8220;Another reason is that people realize that all these new &#8220;cool&#8221; 3D games already have been made. And usually the original is more fun to play.&#8221; For example, [The Secret of Monkey Island](/2011/05/12/top-10-iphone-games-ported-iphone-games/ "Top 10 iPhone Games – Ported iPhone Games") and all versions of <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)" target="_blank">DOOM</a> are available titles on Macintosh Garden.

What are you waiting for?!?

Oh ya&#8230; that&#8217;s right&#8230;. here&#8217;s the link: <a title="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/" href="http://www.macintoshgarden.org/" target="_blank">http://www.macintoshgarden.org/</a>
