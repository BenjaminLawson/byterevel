Point-and-Click games aren&#8217;t for the impatient (unless you use a walkthrough which is cheating but makes the game more enjoyable. I am pretty impatient and use the walkthroughs for these games). Which means they aren&#8217;t for everyone. But I encourage you to try some out, even if you have to look up a walkthrough. The stories of the games can be quite engaging and entertaining. Some of the them are just downright silly, while some have a very serious story to them. Here are my favorite Point-and-Click iPhone Games. You&#8217;ll notice most of them have been [ported](/2011/05/12/top-10-iphone-games-ported-iphone-games/) from other devices.

**1. The Secret of Monkey Island**

Developer: LucasArts

Price: $2.99 (iPhone), $4.99 (iPad)

This classic game is what I meant by silly. It follows a wannabe pirate named Guybrush Threepwood who ventures to Melee Island to become a fierce pirate. As he becomes a pirate, his lady friend becomes kidnapped by the vicious LeChuck and taken to Monkey Island. This game has 4 sequels, which means it is either awesome or over inflated. I&#8217;d like to go with the first.

</div>

**2. Myst**

Developer: Cyan Worlds

Price: $4.99

This game is very elegant as well as frustrating (for me, as I have little patience). It has very clean graphics and was made some time ago. This ported version is one of the more serene games as you are a traveler in an unknown world trying to make sense of what happened to you. The storyline is humongous as you travel through multiple worlds taking note of your changing surroundings and notes left behind by the characters you don&#8217;t meet.

**3. Beneath a Steel Sky**

Developer: Revolution

Price: $2.99

If you&#8217;ve noticed the trend, these games are all [ports.](/2011/05/12/top-10-iphone-games-ported-iphone-games/) Beneath a Steel Sky is a very interesting Point-and-Click game set in a dystopic future world. You take the role of a boy who lived in a tribal group on the outskirts of a large city who is taken by the military for unknown reasons. You try to make sense of the events that have happened as you also try to uncover a wicked plot that the dystopic government has been assembling.

**4. HECTOR: Badge of Carnage Ep. 1**

Developer: Straanlooper

Price: $3.99

This game is not only perverse, it is crude and is rightfully recommended for over 17 years of age. In this first episode, you play as Hector, the city&#8217;s best negotiator as he tries to fulfill the demands of a &#8220;terrorist&#8221; who captured &#8220;hostages.&#8221; You&#8217;ll find yourself at times trying to convince a prostitute to give you her garter to convincing a criminal to take his pants off. Now that you are either disgusted or excited, you shouldn&#8217;t or should buy this game.

**5. Sam and Max Episode 1: The Penal Zone**

Developer: Telltale Inc.

Price: $6.99

This game was ported from the PC and was one of the first games to be available for iPad. It contains 3-D graphics as well as a pretty awesome story. It follows 2 detectives, 1 a dog and the other a rabbit as they try stop an intergalactic invader named Skunk&#8217;ape. The graphics are great as well as the intrigue of the entire plot.

**6. City of Secrets**

Developer: Aidem Media

Price: $0.99

This game has it all for those of you who don&#8217;t want to fork over a lot of money to the developers. City of Secrets has great 3-D graphics, as well as an interesting storyline. You follow the heroes, Rex and Mr. Mole as they try to uncover a &#8220;sinister plot.&#8221; There is much problem solving involved as well as uncovering the mysteries required to beat the game. The game maybe hard to follow at times but luckily, the developers added a feature that allows you to search for items in the screen.

**7. Simon the Sorceror**

Developer: iPhSoft

Price: $1.99

This game uses retro and old-school graphics, similar to the original Monkey Island series but lacks the modern update that LucasArts gave Monkey Island. This 90&#8217;s game deals with goblins and potions, magic and beards, as you play as Simon, a teenager who was somehow transported into a dimension where cloak and pointy hats are the hottest things for humans to wear. Simon has to use &#8220;logic and magical skills&#8221; to progress through the game.

**8. 1112 Episodes 01/02**

Developer: Agharta Studio

Price: $4.99 &#8211; $7.99

In this mystery game, you play as a citizen named Louis as he tries to uncover the &#8220;reasons behind his constant headaches and strange dreams.&#8221; This may seem weird, but the game is quite interesting as it takes place in present day Jalonsville (doesn&#8217;t exist), New Jersey. The graphics are enticing but the storyline could come across as weird.

**9. Flight of the Amazon Queen**

Developer: iPhSoft

Price: $1.99

Flight of the Amazon Queen contains aspects of Indiana Jones and The Secret of Monkey Island. It has the graphics and humor the LucasArts put such detail into but it has a storyline that one would expect to see with Indiana Jones. Sadly, Flight of the Amazon Queen hasn&#8217;t been as prolific as other Point and Click Games, but it is nonetheless a great one to check out.

**10. Broken Sword: Director&#8217;s Cut**

Developer: Revolution

Price: $4.99

This game has been quite prolific in the Point-and-Click games section of the App Store and is for good reason. A murder goes off in a place called Palais Royale and you play as a lady named Nico who has been brought to Paris to interview a statesman named Pierre Carchon. As you venture through France, you become closer and closer to the crime and soon it becomes personal&#8230;Well, only for Nico. You just want to finish the game. Or not.
