While I don&#8217;t consider myself to be an avid video gamer, what I find most interesting about the media genre is the story, visual, and audio craft. Depending on the medium, whether it is a console or handheld device, I am interested in the defamiliarization that developers strive to achieve with their gamecraft. When I stumble upon a game that is aesthetically original, I can&#8217;t help feeling intrigued.

I have always been interested in [Simogo&#8217;s](http://simogo.com) creative work. As a development firm, every application that they&#8217;ve released is imbued with the mystical creativity that indie developers strive to achieve. From Beat Sneak Bandit&#8217;s combination of music with puzzle solving to the wistful Bumpy Road, which out of its simplicity and grace smoothly expounds a touching story. Another example of Simogo&#8217;s boundary pushing creativity is their Device 6. Combining a text-based adventure with a book-like reading is perhaps one of the most unique and interesting iPhone game experiences. Rather than simple puzzle solving, Simogo forces users to step-back and appreciate the creative genius invested into the application.

Most recently, Simogo released The Sailor&#8217;s Dream. This game immerses in a small pocket universe of an application with dream-like visuals. Users are drawn to explore a world solely for the purpose of exploration. Wrapped with beautiful music, this application moves away from solely creative expression towards creative storytelling. The adventure is more about figuring out a story and less so about progressing through a quest or journey. Reading like a storybook, this application almost turns the user into a character who is living outside of the author. The Sailor&#8217;s Dream captures a beautiful sense of mystical, explorative storytelling.

If you are interested in checking out some aesthetically creative iOS applications, I highly encourage you to look into Simogo&#8217;s applications.
