CSS Desk allows you to incorporate [HTML](/2011/06/03/html-tutorial-i-the-basics/) and CSS simultaneously in an online editor. This allows you to test out your ideas without the need for uploading them of the tedious process of dragging and dropping files from the Hard Drive onto the Window (sarcasm). CSS Desk is a very cool website. It works like this:

1. In the top box, paste and edit all of your [HTML](/2011/06/09/html-tutorial-ii-simple-tags-for-your-usage/). Don&#8217;t worry about the <html> and the <head> tags. From <body> to </body>, post all what is in between and include the two tags.

2. In the bottom box, paste and edit all of your CSS just as you would in a separate CSS file or between the <style> tags.

3. CSS Desk automatically simulates the HTML/CSS document.

Some additional features include:

  * giving you the option of choosing a default background color
  * resetting your document with the click of a button
  * a share option that generates a unique URL for your document that will allow you to share your work with friends and colleagues
  * the option to download your work as an HTML file (with the CSS included in <style> tags)
  * remembering your document between visits to CSS Desk

With that being said, [here](http://cssdesk.com/) is the link to the website.
