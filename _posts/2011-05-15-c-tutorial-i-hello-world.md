Many consider C++ to be cliche and a bit ancient. But nonetheless, it is great for beginners who want to start programming, but don&#8217;t know where to start. If you learn C or C++, Objective-C becomes much easier to learn. And believe us, Objective-C is not for beginner programmers.

Before you get started programming in C++, you should have a IDE. For Windows, I suggestÂ Bloodshed <a title="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" href="http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html" target="_blank">Dev-C++</a>. For Macintosh, <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12&ls=1" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id422352214?mt=12&ls=1" target="_blank">Xcode</a> is ideal, with <a title="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/heliossr2" href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/heliossr2" target="_blank">Eclipse for C++</a> being another choice (Eclipse is also available for Windows and Linux).

Anyhow, take a look at the C++ code: (Bold is C++, text after &#8220;//&#8221; is a comment. That is, it isn&#8217;t run when the program is compiled.)

<table border="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>#include <iostream></strong> //imports the basic output/input library<strong>using namespace std;</strong> //without this, you woud need to type &#8220;std::&#8221; before most lines of code in your program</p> 
      
      <p>
        <strong>int main()</strong> //the main function of the program; starting point of all C++ programs
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>{ </strong>//left curly bracket; it begins/opens the main function
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>cout <<&#8220;Hello World!&#8221;;</strong> //cout is what you tell the program to say to the user; this outputs &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; in the console window
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>system(&#8220;pause&#8221; );</strong> //This tells the program to pause the program so that the user can actually see what is output on the screen; use this if you are running the program on Windows, don&#8217;t use this on Macintosh or Linux
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>cout << endl; </strong>//outputs a line break, all further output is done on the next line
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>return 0;</strong> //Tells the computer that the program ran successfully
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <strong>} </strong>//right curly bracket; this ends/closes the main function</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> 
        
        <p>
          &nbsp;
        </p>
        
        <p>
          And now you know how the program works! Enjoy!
