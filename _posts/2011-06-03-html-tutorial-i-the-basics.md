Regardless of what people tell you, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is not hard to learn. It is arguably the easiest of the 4 major Web Development languages (HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP) to learn. In the following tutorial, you&#8217;ll learn how to create a webpage that says &#8220;Hello World!&#8221;

You can use any plain text editor to write the webpage. If you use a Mac, TextEdit works well. If you use a PC, Notepad works. If you want to try a very good HTML Text Editor, use <a title="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download" href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> orÂ [HTML Notepad](http://www.htmlnotepad.net/ "HTML Notepad"). They both support many features (such as code highlighting) in Python, Perl, CSS, [Javascript](/2011/05/09/javascript-tutorial-i-hello-world/ "Javascript"), and More!

In order to compile your HTML page, simply go to File -> Save As and save it as a .html file. If given the options choose UTF-8 encoding and save as &#8216;all files&#8217;. Saving procedures differ from program to program. Now that you&#8217;ve saved it, drag and drop that .html file onto your favorite web browser (assuming you have content on your page, it will appear). If you are using a non-HTML specific editor, ensure that Rich Text Formatting is turned off.

When you create a simple HTML page, you can use the following template. In most HTML web pages, you need to include the following.

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><strong>&lt;HTML&gt;</strong> &lt;!-- Required--&gt;</pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;HEAD&gt;</strong> &lt;!-- This shows the title of the page--&gt;</pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;TITLE&gt;</strong>--Include Name Here--<strong>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</strong> &lt;!-- This is the Title of your page--&gt;</pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;BODY&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre>--You include all the Webpage content here--</pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/BODY&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/HTML&gt;</strong></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

&nbsp;

The first thing you should know about HTML, is that it uses things called &#8220;Tags.&#8221; The Tags in the template are <BODY>, <HEAD>, <HTML>&#8230;You get what they are. They are pieces of code included in the <>.

When you start a tag, you write the tag above what you&#8217;re including in your tag. After you finish what you wanted to include in your tag, you end it with a tag that looks like this </BODY>. It doesn&#8217;t have to say BODY. It is supposed to say whatever the Tag you specified says.

For Hello World!, you use the template above. But where it says <BODY>, you hit return once. Then type &#8220;Hello World!&#8221; The code should look like this. What you should type is italicized.

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <pre><strong>&lt;HTML&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;HEAD&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;TITLE&gt;</strong>My Hello World! Page<strong>&lt;/TITLE&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/HEAD&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;BODY&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre>Hello World!</pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/BODY&gt;</strong></pre>
      
      <pre><strong>&lt;/HTML&gt;</strong></pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In order to test out your program, save your program as an html file by typing in .html after the document&#8217;s name. Then drag and drop the .html file into your browser and watch the magic!

And now you have mastered the basics: Remember the following

1. HTML uses Tags. i.e. <BODY>, </BODY>

2. You have to include the ending tag. You know it is the ending tag because it contains the same letters as the previous tag, as well as a forward slash before the word.

3. You can incorporate [Javascript](/2011/05/09/javascript-tutorial-i-hello-world/) if you are feeling adventurous.

4. And finally, you can use basic Text Editing software. Word won&#8217;t work, but even more basic ones that are pre-installed on the computer will. Try Notepad and Text Edit (for PC and Mac, respectively). Also, try out HTML Notepad. It works beautifully, and lets you incorporate Javascript, Perl&#8230;

Enjoy!
