  Those of us that spend great amounts of time in front of a computer monitor have likely been told about the 20-20-20 rule by our family, friends, and optometrists. The rule states that after staring at a computer monitor for 20 minutes, you should look at something at least 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. The goal of this exercise is to give your eyes a break. It helps prevent vision loss, dry eyes, eye redness, eye fatigue, and other forms of eye irritation.

    ProtectYourVision.org's Break Reminder Screen
  </p>
</div>

If you try to follow this rule, you will no doubt find that it is extremely difficult to remember to look away from your monitor and/or that it is annoying to keep track of 20 minute intervals. <a title="http://protectyourvision.org/" href="http://protectyourvision.org/" target="_blank">ProtectYourVision.org</a> recognizes these difficulties and provides a convenient solution. The web service allows you to set a specified amount of time between breaks, after which it will sound a chime in order to remind you to look away from your glaring computer screen. If you hit the &#8220;let&#8217;s take a break&#8221; button that appears at your designated break time, ProtectYourVision will turn your entire screen black as it counts down from the selected break length time. As a bonus, it will show you some eye exercises that you can practice during your break.

For your sake, I hope that you use this invaluable tool. It&#8217;s easy to set up, and your eyes will thank you!
