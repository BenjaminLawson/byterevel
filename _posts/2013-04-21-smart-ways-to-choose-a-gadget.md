When it comes to buying gadgets, a lot of care and consideration needs to go into any purchase. While quite a few brands put out products with similar functions, an equal amount cannot measure up to the competition. Knowing the difference will make you happier with your purchase, as well as keep you from spending money on something that you won&#8217;t want. Here&#8217;s what you need to know in order to make the smartest purchases on gadgets!

**Figure Out What You Want **
  
The firststep is determining what gadget you are specifically looking for. More importantly, what you can expect this particular device to do for you. If you want something that works like a portable computer but has the interface and functionality a smart phone, then newer tablet releases should fit this need. Knowing what you expect from the device will help you narrow down options as well, as there are plenty of electronics that offer less functionality and/or features than others.

**Release Dates **
  
Once you have a product in mind, pay close attention to the top of the line. These companies are known to release a couple of new gadgets a year to improve or add more features to their existing popular products. If you are hoping for a feature you haven&#8217;t found, it might be on the way within a year or so. Or, if you are looking to save some money, the latest version should knock the price of the previous model down to make it more affordable for you.

**Shop Around **
  
The key is really shopping around. You have to both look online and in stores in your area for whatever you&#8217;re looking for. This is going to give you a good idea of the average price of this device, as well as where you might be able to save some money. Many online locations offer coupons for free shipping or percentages off your order. A little bit of patience and determination can end up saving you big. Be sure to do a Google search for any coupons or promotions (try &#8220;Best Buy + Coupons&#8221; for example, if you&#8217;re shopping there) to make sure you get the best deal possible.

**Reviews **
  
Public opinion is important to any company that makes gadgets, but it should also be equally important to you. For popular devices, you should be able to find hundreds of reviews on various websites offering you unique insight into how products work and/or what people love or hate about it. This will give you the opportunity to test drive a device through other people&#8217;s experiences without ever making a purchase. Take advantage of what people have felt inclined to write, and understand what makes the bad reviews bad, and what makes people really love this product. See which of these you can relate to the most, and you should be able to determine the gadget in particular that suits you the best.
