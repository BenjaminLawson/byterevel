  Smart TVs have the potential to be the big hit of the future. However, considering that currently only 40 percent of the ‘smart’ connected TVs are actually being used as intended, maybe that isn&#8217;t so likely. Adding apps to your TV sounds like a good idea in theory, but customers are finding it more difficult than expected. Yet they are still buying Smart TVs… for now.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As global economic growth continues to sputter and inflation rises, will families spend their hard-earned money on this technology? The most popular apps for Smart TVs include things like Facebook, which is a very individualized program. How will this affect TV usage? Will consumers want to check their Facebook on their TVs? Other things, like Netflix apps, have a clearer connection to the TV. It all depends on the consumer and their needs.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  More things confuse the issue. The huge differences between the manufactures of TVs mean that each app has to be made-to-fit for that brand. No one-size-fits-all here. This increases the cost, complexity, and time needed for Smart TV manufacturers to really get things going. The ease of use is also a factor. Your TV remote has to be capable of everything a mouse can do, which just isn’t true. To make up for this, manufactures have to re-invent what consumers see online. It has to seem familiar while still giving the customers the ability to control it simply by remote. Not an easy task.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This is where commitment comes in. Will the TV manufactures, big names like Samsung, LG, Panasonic, want to deeply invest their money in this new technology? Or will the find a different new technology to invest in? Much of this is up to the consumer. After all, you can only sell what the consumer will buy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Smart TVs may very well be the next big hit. Fully integrating your online experience with a big screen TV sounds like a great idea. But is it practical? Will TV manufacturers be able to successfully pull it off? And, if they do, will the consumers go for it? Only time will tell.
