        I've always been fascinated by the intersection between human phenomena and computing, specifically in fields of education, financial markets, and creative design. My programming interests are in machine learning, artificial intelligence, neural networks, cryptography, blockchain infrastructure, market making, simulation and modeling, and quantum computing. Outside of ByteRevel, I co-founded and spent four years working on a software consulting company, Quadral Apps (It's now defunct as the founders have all left). My interests outside of computer science are poverty alleviation, humanitarian engineering, education, financial markets and economics research.

<p>For developers beginning the iOS development process, it can be difficult to get a mix of programming in with an organized setup. What I mean is that learning iOS development can be a somewhat discouraging process (as I described in my personal experience). Xcode is not the easiest IDE to use. Objective-C is a weird mix of Java-like syntax with C coding and Apple’s UI features. On top of that, there are a myriad services that replace actual development with templates or dragging and dropping UI onto a screen and calling that an app. With such a striking dichotomy of services, the beginner programmer is torn between creativity and simplicity, between learning and ability. This makes learning application development, especially for someone with little or no programming experience, an overwhelming and slightly discouraging endeavor.</p>

<p>With my personal ramble aside, let’s talk about a neat little technology called QuickDialog. QuickDialog is a package released by ESCOZ Inc that allows iOS developers to easily use UI elements in their code. The package comes with an assortment of elements that are free to use in an iOS application. Ranging from buttons and sliders to scrolling UI and switches, QuickDialog is an easy to use, opensource package that any beginning developer should check out. You can visit ESCOZ Inc’s web page on QuickDialog <a href="http://escoz.com/open-source/quickdialog">here</a>.</p>
